Pronunciation

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 1

§1.1. Choice of dialect.

The pronunciation of Tagalog, like that of English, varies more or less markedly from place to place
and from one social and educational class to another. Among the distinctive regional dialects may be noted
at least the following six: Bataan, Batangas, Bulacan, Manila, Tanay-Paete, and Tayabas. The dialect of
Bulacan is sometimes considered to be the “purest”, showing perhaps fewer signs than the others of the
influence of Spanish, English, or neighboring Philippine languages. But it is the dialect of Manila that is now
generally regarded as standard, in both pronunciation and grammar, by virtue both of its prestige as the
dialect of the capital and of its overwhelming numerical superiority.

Within the Manila dialect-area itself a considerable range of pronunciation types are found, the
differences depending not only upon the social and educational class of the speaker, but also, to some
extent, upon his age. Pronunciation differences related to the age of the speaker are particularly noticeable
in the case of words borrowed into Tagalog from English. Younger speakers, influenced by their generally
superior knowledge of English, tend in some cases to approximate the American pronunciation of such
borrowed words to a greater extent than do older speakers. For example, where younger speakers use nars
as the Tagalized form of English ‘nurse’, older speakers may use narsis (based on the English plural), which
has a form that is more in accord with the characteristic word and syllable patterns of Tagalog itself (see
§1.22).

It is upon the Manila dialect, as spoken by recent college graduates, that the present treatment of
Tagalog pronunciation is based. In cases where members of the group whose speech is being described differ
among themselves with regard to a particular feature of pronunciation, the most common variant is taken as
the standard, and the less common ones are noted as such.

§1.2. Classification of speech sounds.

Figure 1 shows and labels certain of the organs used in speech. Not shown are the LUNGS, which, in
exhalation, provide the stream of air that is acted upon by the other organs to produce the various speech
sounds. The following further points should be noted:

The VOCAL CORDS, two bands of cartilage attached to the sides of the larynx, are capable of being

held wide apart, drawn close together, or brought into contact with one another along their entire length.
All three of these positions may be utilized in speech. When the vocal cords are drawn close together, the
passage of air through the space between them (the GLOTTIS) causes them to vibrate. The vibration
produces a characteristic noise known as VOICE, which is an important feature of many speech sounds.

The ROOF OF THE MOUTH is divided, for purposes of the description of sound-production, into
three parts: the ALVEOLAR RIDGE the HARD PALATE, and the VELUM. The alveolar ridge lies behind
the upper teeth, and extends back from them to the point at which the roof of the mouth becomes
concave. The hard palate, which begins at this point, includes the rest of the bony portion of the roof of
the mouth, The velum, the movable back portion of the roof of the mouth, is shown in Figure 1 in one of
the two significant positions it can assume in speech. In the other of these positions, it is drawn back to
touch the rear wall of the throat.

Three parts of the TONGUE are also distinguished for purposes of description: the BLADE, the
FRONT, and the BACK. These are the parts that lie under the alveolar ridge, the hard palate, and the velum
respectively when the tongue is in a position of rest. The extremity of the tongue, a portion of the blade, is
called the TIP.

In the articulation of speech sounds, the parts of the speech apparatus shown in Figure | may function
as: (1) RESONATORS, (2) ARTICULATORS, or (3) POINTS OF ARTICULATION.

(1) The chief RESONATORS are the throat, the mouth, and the nasal cavity. Through changes in
size and shape, these resonators can reinforce various sound-producing vibrations. The air passing from the
throat may escape through the mouth, through the nasal cavity, or through both. If the velum is raised to
touch the rear wall of the throat, the nasal cavity is blocked off, and the air escapes through the mouth
alone. If the velum is lowered and the passage of air from the mouth is blocked by the lips or the tongue,
the air escapes through the nasal cavity alone. If the velum is lowered and the passage of air from the mouth
is not blocked, the air escapes through both the mouth and the nasal cavity.

(2) The ARTICULATORS are organs which, by assuming different shapes or positions, help to give
speech sounds their characteristic acoustic properties. The most important and versatile of the articulators
is the tongue, which has a flexibility that enables it to vary the size and shape of the mouth cavity in many
different ways. The lips are also important articulators.

(3) The POINTS OF ARTICULATION are the parts of the speech apparatus near which or against
which the articulators are placed in the production of the various speech sounds. Among the important
points of articulation are the upper lip, the upper teeth, and the several parts of the roof of the mouth.

Every speech sound is classifiable as either a vowel or a consonant, in terms of the way in which it is
porduced. A vowel is any voiced speech sound (i.e., a sound during which the vocal cords vibrate) in the
course of which the air issues through the throat and the mouth without obstruction and without such
narrowing of the cavitics as to cause audible friction. All other speech sounds are classified as consonants.

Differences among vowel sounds may be due to differences in the position taken by the tongue
and/or differences in the shape assumed by the lips. Vowel sounds may also differ from one another in
relative duration, in the relative tenseness of the speech musculature, and in the presence or absence of
nasalization. Vowels of relatively long duration are called LONG; those of relatively short duration are
called SHORT. Vowels produced with relatively tense musculature are called TENSE; other vowels are
called LAX. A NASALIZED vowel is one during which the velum is lowered, allowing the escape of air
through the nose as well as through the mouth; a non-nasalized, or ORAL, vowel is one in which the velum
is drawn back, blocking the escape of air through the nose.

Two aspects of the position of the tongue are significant in the differentiation of vowel sounds:
relative height and relative frontness. (The relative height and relative frontness of the tongue determine the
shape of the mouth and throat cavities, which, as noted above, serve as resonators, selectively reinforcing
sound-producing vibrations.) Three general classes of vowels are distinguished on the basis of relative
tongue-height: HIGH vowels, MID vowels, and LOW vowels. High vowels are those in which the tongue is
close to the roof of the mouth, low vowels those in which the tongue is far from the roof of the mouth, and
mid vowels those in which the tongue is midway between high and low. Each of these tongue-height classes
may be further divided into an UPPER and a LOWER subclass.

Three general classes of vowels are also distinguished on the basis of relative
tongue-frontness: FRONT vowels, CENTRAL vowels, and BACK vowels. Front vowels are those in which
the tongue is forward of its resting position, back vowels those in which the tongue is backward of its
resting position, and central vowels those in which it is neither forward nor backward of its resting position.

Chart 1 shows a grid upon which the approximate tongue-position of any given vowel can be
indicated. The areas delimited by horizontal lines correspond to tongue-height classes. The areas delimited
by vertical lines correspond to tongue-frontness classes. It is upon a grid of this kind that the
tongue-positions of the vowels of Tagalog (and, for purposes of comparison, those in English) are indicated
in §1.5.

Three lip-shapes may be distinguished for purposes of the description of vowels: SPREAD (roughly,
the sahpe of the lips in smiling), NEUTRAL (roughly, the shape of the lips in panting), and ROUNDED
(roughly, the shape of the lips in whistling).

Consonant sounds may differ from one another in one or more of three ways:

(1) the point of articulation;
(2) the manner of articulation;
(3) the presence or absence of voice.

As indicated above, the POINT OF ARTICULATION of a sound is the part of the speech apparatus
near which or against which an articulator is placed in the production of the sound — or, put somewhat
differently, the point at which the narrowest space is left for the escape of air, or at which the escape of air
is blocked. In describing the consonant sounds of Tagalog, and, for purposes of comparison, those of
English, seven points of articulation are distinguished. The labels given to these points of articulation are
listed below. Each label is followed by a brief statement of how the air passage is narrowed or blocked in
the given case.

a. LABIAL (the lower lip approaches or touches the upper lip)

b. LABIODENTAL (the lower lip approaches or touches the upper teeth)

¢. DENTAL (the tip of the tongue approaches or touches the upper teeth)

d. ALVEOLAR (the tip or blade of the tongue approaches or touches the alveolar ridge)

e, PALATAL (the front of the tongue approaches or touches the hard palate)
f. VELAR (the back of the tongue approaches or touches the velum)
GLOTTAL (the vocal cords approach or touch one another).

By the MANNER OF ARTICULATION is meant the way in which the air escapes. The consonants of
Tagalog and English may be divided into seven classes on the basis of manner of articulation. The labels
given to six of these classes are listed immediately below; each label is followed by a brief statement of how
the air escapes in the given case.

a. STOP (the air passage is completely blocked)

b. NASAL (the air, completely blocked from escape through the mouth, escapes through the

nose)

c. FRICATIVE (the air escapes through a relatively narrow passage between an articulator and a
point of articulation)

d,  AFFRICATE (first the air passage is completely blocked; then the block is rather slowly
released, and the air escapes through a relatively narrow passage between an articulator and a
point of articulation)

e. LATERAL (the air escapes over and around the sides of the tongue, passage over the center of
the tongue being blocked)

f. TRILL (the air is intermittently blocked and allowed to escape, through a series of rapid
tongue-movements; a single such movement is called a TAP)

The seventh class includes sounds which, from the point of view of manner of articulation, are similar
to vowels, but which, unlike the vowels themselves, are characterized by movement from one vocalic
tongue position to another. This seventh class is:

8. GLIDE.

VOICE as noted above, is the characteristic noise produced by the vibration of the vocal cords. A
sound during which voice is present is called VOICED; a sound during which voice is absent is called
VOICELESS.

§1.3. Phonemes.

Every language makes use of a considerable variety of speech sounds. Not all of the differences among
the sounds that occur in a language, however, are used to distinguish words of the language from one
another. In English, for example, the initial consonant sounds of the words goose and geese are not
identical in their articulation. The point of articulation of the first is the velum; that of the second, the hard
palate. But the difference in articulation between these sounds never constitutes the only difference
between two English words. In the other hand, the difference between the initial consonant sounds of glass
and class (the first is voiced, the second voiceless) can, and often does, constitute the only difference
between two English words.

From the point of view of their function in distinguishing the words of a language from one another,
the speech sounds of a language arrange themselves into a system of contrasting classes. These contrasting
classes are called the PHONEMES of the language. Two speech sounds of a language belong to the same
phoneme if, first, they cannot constitute the only difference between two words, and, second, they have a
certain degree of articulatory similarity to one another. Both requirements are met by the initial sounds of
goose and geese (which are similar in being voiced stops), and the two sounds thus belong to a single English
phoneme. Two speech sounds of a language belong to different phonemes whenever the difference between
them may constitute the only difference between two words. Thus the initial consonant sounds of glass and
class belong to two different English phonemes.

A speech sound that is a member of a phoneme is known as an ALLOPHONE of that phoneme. Thus
the initial sounds of goose and geese are said to be allophones of the same phoneme.

§1.4. Phonetic and phonemic notation.

Since conventional Tagalog spelling (cf. §1.30) does not reflect the pronunciation of the language
with perfect accuracy or consistency, it is necessary to make use of a special system of notation for
representing Tagalog speech sounds and phonemes. For the same reason (and to a much greater degree), a
special notation is necessary for those speech sounds and phonemes of English with which the sounds of
Tagalog can profitably be compared.

An accurate and consistent written representation of speech sounds, in which cach symbol represents
one and only one sound, is called a PHONETIC NOTATION. In this book all phonetic notations appear
between square brackets: e.g., [bu-x/"d].

An accurate and consistent written representation of phonemes, in which cach symbol represents one
and only one phoneme, is called a PHONEMIC NOTATION, In this book all phonemic notations appear
between slant lines: e.g., /bu-kid/.

Citations in conventional spelling are italicized, and English translations of Tagalog words and
utterances appear between single quotes: ¢.g., bukid ‘farm’.

The following list shows the twenty-three symbols used in this book to represent the vowel and
consonant phonemes of Tagalog:

JabdefFghikImnnoprsttuwy 7%

As can be seen, all but three of the symbols on the list are also used as letters in conventional written
English (although the Tagalog sounds represented by the symbols are in some cases quite different from the
English sounds usually represented by the letters). The three symbols not used as letters in written English
are /n{/t8/, and /*/, The sounds represented by these symbols are discussed in §§1.16, 1.18, and 1.14
respectively,

In addition to the above symbols for the phonemes of Tagalog, certain other symbols are used for the
phonemes of English, and for allophones of the Tagalog phonemes. The meaning of these symbols is
explained as the symbols are introduced.

§1.5. Tagalog vowels: introduction.
Chart 2 shows the vowel phonemes of Tagalog, arranged according to the approximate position

assumed by the tongue in the articulation of the vowels. (See §1.2 for explanation of vowel-position chart.)
The range of tongue positions of each of the vowel phonemes is delimited by heavy lines.

As Chart 2 shows, Tagalog has five vowel phonemes, symbolized /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, and /u/. From the
point of view of tongue height, there are two high-vowel phonemes, /i/ and /u/, two mid-vowel phonemes,

fe{ and fo/, and one vowel phoneme with a range from mid to low, /a/. From the point of view of tongue
frontness, there are two front-vowel phonemes, /i/ and fe/, one central-vowel phoneme, /a/, and two

back-vowel phonemes, /u/ and /o/. There is a correlation in Tagalog, as in English, between the tongue
frontness and the shape assumed by the lips in the articulation of the vowel. The front vowels of Tagalog
are characterized by spread lips, the central vowel by neutral lip position, and the back vowels by rounded
lips.

Chart 3 shows the principal allophones of the Tagalog vowel phonemes. As in Chart 2, the range of
tongue positions of the phonemes is delimited by heavy lines. Broken lines are used to mark the
approximate boundary between allophones of a single phoneme.

As Chart 3 shows, cach of the Tagalog vowel phonemes has two principal allophones. The principal
allophones of the phoneme fi/ are (i) (upper-high front) and [/] (lower-high front); the principal
allophones of fe/ are [e] (upper-mid front) and [e] (lower-mid front); those of /a/ are [9] (with a range
from upper-mid central to upper-low central) and [a] (lower-low central); those of /o/, [o] (upper-mid
back) and [9] (lower-mid back); and those of /u/, [u] (upper-high back) and [vu] (lower-high back).

Chart 4 shows certain English vowel phonemes and diphthongs to which the Tagalog vowels are
compared in subsequent sections. (A DIPHTHONG may be defined, for practical purposes, as a vowel
followed by a glide consonant in the same syllable.) The English vowels and diphthongs are arranged, once
more, according to tongue position. In the case of the diphthongs, the tongue position shown is that of the
initial vowel of the diphthong. The /y/ represents a glide upward and forward from the vowel position, the
/w],a glide upward and back from the vowel position.

The symbols in Chart 4 represent the following vowels and diphthongs in Midland American English
(ie., the English spoken in most parts of the United States other than New England and the Southeast):

liy/ asin ‘beat’ {oiyt/
it] as in ‘bit’ fort}
Jey{ asin ‘bait’ {bett/
Jel as in ‘bet foet{
jaf as in ‘but’ {bat/
faf as in ‘pot’ {pat/
Jof as in ‘bought’ foot!
Jow/ asin ‘boat’ {bowt}
jf asin ‘pur’ (pu
luw/ as in ‘boot’ {buwt}

(Some Midland dialects lack a distinction between /a/ and /9/.) (Certain English vowels and diphthongs are
not shown in Chart 4. These include the upper-low-front vowel /ae/, as in ‘pat’ fpaet/, which has no
Tagalog counterpart, and certain diphthongs that are discussed in connection with the Tagalog diphthongs
in §1,11,)

The Tagalog vowels are presented in detail in §§1.6 through 1.10: fi/ in §1.6; /ef in §1.7; /af in
§1.8; fof in §1.9; /uf in §1.10. The Tagalog diphthongs are presented in §1.11.

Before the individual vowel phonemes and diphthongs of Tagalog are discussed, a few general
observations may be made about the Tagalog vowel system as a whole. All Tagalog vowels show a
correlation between length and tenseness, long vowels tending to be tense, short vowels lax. (Long vowels
are marked in the phonemic transcriptions of this book by a raised dot following the vowel symbol: thus
fir} is long, /i/ short, as in linis /litnis/ ‘cleanliness’.) Vowel length in Tagalog is phonemic: that is, there are
pairs of words that are distinguished from one another on the basis of vowel length alone (cf. §1.12
and — for a discussion of the relation of vowel length to stress — §1.29).

As in American English, nasalized vowels frequently occur in Tagalog before or after the nasal
consonants /m/j, /n/, and /n/ (see §1.16). Thus the vowels in words like the following would frequently be
nasalized: lamlam /lamlam/ ‘gloom’, bunton j/bunton/ ‘heap’, hangang /hangan/ ‘until’, manganak
/mananak/ ‘give birth’. In other positions, Tagalog vowels are oral.

The present five-phoneme Tagalog vowel system has developed historically from a three-phoneme

system, in which there was one front-vowel phoneme, /i/, one central-vowel- phoneme, /a/, and one
back-vowel phoneme, /u/. The change from the three-vowel to the five vowel system (with the addition of
the phonemes /e/ and /o/) very likely has been brought about through the incorporation into Tagalog of
many loan words from Spanish and English, by Tagalog speakers more or less familiar with these languages.
While there is no doubt that educated Manila Tagalog now has five vowel phonemes, there are perhaps other
Tagalog dialects that still lack a phonemic distinction between /i/ and /e/ and between /u/ and /o/. And
even in the case of the educated Manila dialect, there are still many instances of interchangeability between
the members of these pairs of phonemes, as is explained in the appropriate sections below.

§1.6. fi/.

The phoneme /i/ has two principal allophones: [i] and [/]. The allophone [i] , an upper-high-front
spread vowel, is similar to the English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in ‘be’ /biy/ or
‘beat’ /biyt/. In English, this vowel is regularly followed by a forward and upward gliding movement of the
tongue (represented by /y/ in phonemic transcriptions of English). In Tagalog, on the other hand, there is
no /y/ glide regularly associated with [i].

The allophone [/], a lower-high-front spread vowel, is similar to the vowel of English ‘bit’ /b/t/.

While the sounds [i] and (/] occur both in English and in Tagalog, the sounds play quite different
roles in the vowel systems of the two languages. In English the difference between the two sounds may be
used in distinguishing two words from one another (¢.g., ‘beat’ and ‘bit’). In Tagalog the difference between
the sounds is never used in this way, and any word in which one of the sounds occurs may be pronounced
with the other as well, with no change of meaning.

PRONUNCIATION 9

Although [i] and [7] are interchangeable in Tagalog without any resultant change of meaning, one or
the other of the sounds is the more usual under certain specifiable conditions. A long /i/ is usually
represented by the [i] allophone. Thus the [i] allophone normally occurs in the following items:

biro {birro’} ‘joke’
kilos {kilos} ‘action’
labi ko flarbi- koh/ ‘my lips’
silya {sitlyahf ‘chair’
team {ti'm/ ‘team’

A short fi/ is usually represented by the [/] allophone. Thus the [7] allophone normally occurs in the
following items:

binata foinata’/ ‘bachelor’
kidlat /kidlat/ ‘lightning’

gabi na fgabi nah/ ‘it’s night now’
labis [la-bis/ ‘surplus’
marami /mara:mih/ ‘many’

A short /i/ in a phrase-final syllable — i.e., a syllable followed by pause — is, however, often represented by
the [i] allophone when the phrase-final word is being emphasized.

Many words that have the phoneme /i/ in a word-final syllable allow the replacement of /i/ by /e/ if
the word is phrase-final. Most of the words that allow alternation between /i/ and /e/ in a phrase-final
syllable are words of native Tagalog origin. (Details and examples of such variation are presented in §1.7.)
Loan words from Spanish and, especially, from English, on the other hand, rarely if ever allow replacement
of {i} by /e/. The /i/’s in the following loan words, for example, are perfectly stable:

abril fabril/ ‘April’

bir foirr{ ‘beer’
boksing {borksin/ ‘boxing’
boluntir {bo-luntic/ ‘volunteer’
jeep {dyi-p} ‘jeep"

mais {ma‘is/ ‘corn’
otomobil fotomorbil/ ‘automobile’
parti {parrtih/ ‘party’

81.7. Je/.

The two principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /e/ are [e] and [e]: respectively, an
upper-mid-front spread vowel and a lower-mid-front spread vowel. The allophone [e] is similar to the
English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in ‘bay’ /bey/ or ‘bait’ /beyt/; the allophone
[e] is similar to the English vowel that occurs in ‘bet’ /bet/.

In the Tagalog of some speakers, the two principal allophones of /e/ are in completely free alternation
with one another. (That is, the two allophones are used interchangeably, each occurring in all the same
contexts as the other.) Other speakers prefer one or the other of the allophones in some or all contexts,
but, since there is no context in which a majority of speakers reject either allophone, either [¢] or [e] may
be used to represent the phoneme in all cases.

Some illustrations of the phoneme /e/ are:

ate fateh{ ‘elder sister’
kape {kapeh/ ‘coffee’
desk [ders(k) ‘desk’
esensya [eseensyah/ ‘fragrance’
Lunes fluvnes/ ‘Monday’
peligro [peli:groh/ ‘danger’
pera /perrah/ ‘money’
sermon {se*rmon/ ‘sermon’

 

ur
10 CHAPTER |

As was mentioned in §1.6, many words that have /i/ in a word-final syllable allow the replacement of
lif by fef if the word is phrase-final. Such alternation between /i/ and /e/ is extremely common in the case
of words of native Tagalog origin with short penultimate vowels; and in fact, the great majority of such
words allow the alternation. For some speakers the alternation in these words is entirely free, the two
phonemes being used interchangeably; for other speakers, either /if or /e/ is normal, the other occurring
under certain conditions of style or in special contexts. At any rate, both /i/ and /e/ are very common in
the final syllable of words like the following, when the words are followed by a pause:

gabi fgabih/ or f{gabeh/ ‘night’
itim Vitim/ or fitem/ “black”
mabait /maba’it} or {maba’et/ ‘kind’

It should be noted that, when words like those just listed are not phrase-final, there is no alternation
between /i/ and /e/, only /i/ occurring under these circumstances. Thus:

gabi ba /gabi bah/ ‘night?’
itim ba Pitim bah/ ‘black?’
mabait ba {maba‘it bah/ ‘kind?°

There is also a good deal of alternation between /i/ and /e/ in phrase-final syllables in words of native
Tagalog origin with long penultimate vowels. The alternation is particularly common in the case of syllables
ending in /h/. (Words that end in phonemic /h/ are written without a final consonant in conventional
orthography; see § §1.17 and 1.30.) The following words illustrate this alternation,

gabi fgarbih/ or /garbeh/ ‘yam’
lalaki flala*kih/ or flala*keh/ ‘man’
sili {silih{ or |sirlehf ‘pepper’

One final case of alternation between /e/ and /i/ may be mentioned. This is the case of a short /e/ ina
word-final syllable which is not phrase-final. The /e/ in such cases may be replaced by /i/, as the following
examples show:

kape pa /kape pah/ or /kapi pah/ ‘more coffee"
Lunes na__/lutnes nahf or flunis nah/ ‘it’s Monday”
sige na {si-ge nah/ or /si-gi nah/ ‘OK’

Sporadic replacement of short /e/ by short /i/ in a non-word-final syllable may also occur, but in
general short /e/ in this position is quite stable. Thus the replacement of short /e/ by short /i/ in words like
the following would be highly unusual:

arkitektura Parkitekturrah/ ‘architecture’
eleksyon feleksyon/ ‘election’
eroplano /eroplanoh/ ‘airplane’

In addition to the cases of alternation between /e/ and fi/ discussed in this section, there are also
certain cases in which a short fe/ is replaced by a long /i/ as a result of the length-shifting effect of certain
suffixes. These cases are discussed in §1.12.

In spite of the many cases of alternation between /e/ and /i/, there is no doubt that the two are
distinct phonemes in Tagalog, since there are a number of pairs of words whose members differ from cach
other only in that one has /e/ while the other has /i/. Examples such pairs are:

benta {oe-ntah/ ‘sale’ binta /dientah} ‘Moro canoe”
Bessie /besih/ ‘Bessie* bisi {bi-sih{ ‘busy’

mesa /mersah/ ‘table’ misa /mi-sah/ ‘mass’

parte /pa'rteh/ ‘part’ parti /parrtih/ ‘party’
senyas {se-nyas/ ‘sign’ sinyas /sinyas/ ‘zinnias”
PRONUNCIATION i

It may be noted that the phoneme /e/, except when it occurs as a replacement for /i/ in a phrase-final
syllable, is usually found in words borrowed into Tagalog from other languages. In native Tagalog words,
the sound most often occurs as a variant of the diphthong /ay/, and is discussed as such in §1.11.

In the Tagalog of certain younger speakers, long /e/ also occurs as a free alternant of the sequence
li'af. These speakers may, for example, pronounce hindi ako ‘not I’ (normally, hindi’ akoh/) as
fhinde'kohj.

§1.8. /a/.

The two principal allophones of Tagalog /a/ are [a] and [a]. [a], a lower-low-central neutral vowel, is
similar to the vowel that occurs in mid-Western American English ‘pot’ /pat/ or ‘part’ /part/. [2] covers a
tange of tonguc-positions, from upper-low central to upper-mid central, and, like {a], is characterized by
neutral lip position. The range of tongue positions of Tagalog (9] includes that of the vowel of American
English ‘but’ /bat/ (lower-mid central), as well as that of the unstressed vowel of ‘sofa’ (upper-mid central),
and that of the vowel that occurs in a common British pronunciation of words like ‘but’ (upper-low
central). For practical purposes, the allophone may be considered identical with the vowel of American
‘but’.

The allophones of Tagalog /a/ are distributed as follows. Long /a/ is always represented by the (al
allophone. Thus the [a] allophone occurs in words like the following:

bakit {barkit/ ‘why’
Juan fhwarn/ ‘Juan’
marso {marrsoh{ ‘March’
pares /partes/ ‘pair’

{af in a phrase-final syllable is also represented by the [a] allophone. Thus the [a] allophone occurs in such
words as:

bola {borlah} “ball”
Klima /klitmah/ ‘climate’
pekas /pe-kas/ ‘freckles’
sulat fsuclat/ ‘letter’

Short /a/ in a non-phrase-final syllable is usually represented by the [2] allophone. Thus [9] would
normally occur in words like the following:

ako J’akoh/ T

damit /damit/ ‘dress’
magaling /magalin/ ‘excellent’
sandali fsandali*} ‘moment’

Short /a/ in a non-phrase-final syllable may, however, be represented by [a] in especially careful or
emphatic speech.

§1.9. fof.

The principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /o/ are [o] and [9]: respectively, upper-mid-back
rounded and Jower-mid-back rounded. The allophone {o] is similar to the vowel that occurs as the first
element of a diphthong in Midland American English ‘boat’ /bowt/ or ‘bow’ (‘bowknot’) /bow/. The
allophone [9] is similar to the vowel of Midwestern American English ‘bought’ /bot/ or ‘Baugh’ /bo/.

As in the case of the other mid-vowel phoneme, /e/ (see §1.7), the two allophones of /o/ are in free
alternation for some speakers, while others prefer one or the other of the allophones in some or all
contexts, Once again, then, cither allophone may be used to represent the phoneme in all cases.

12 CHAPTER I

Some illustrations of the phoneme /o/ are:

bunso /bunso’/ ‘youngest child”
hapon /ha:pon{ ‘afternoon’

Joe {dyorh{ ‘Joe’

00 ['o*oh} ‘yes’

otomobil fotomorbil/ ‘automobile’
pontimpen /pontimpen{ ‘fountain pen’
ubo Puboh/ ‘cough’

The phoneme /o/ alternates with the phoneme /u/ under certain conditions specified in §1.10. Like
alternation between /i/ and /e/, alternation between /u/ and /o/ is characteristic mainly of that part of the
Tagalog vocabulary which is of native Tagalog origin. The large stock of Tagalog words borrowed from
Spanish and English, on the other hand, shows relatively little alternation between fof and /u/. In
particular, it may be noted that, in a non-word-final syllable, long /o/ (which occurs in this position almost
exclusively in words of foreign origin) is never replaced by long /u/. The long /o/’s of the following words,
for example, are perfectly stable:

bola {bo-lah/ ‘ball’
kotse /kortseh/ ‘car’

loko flo-koh/ “crazy”
notebook Jnovtbuk/ ‘notebook’
oras Porras/ ‘time’

In a few cases, long /o/ may occur as an alternant of the diphthong /aw/ or the sequence /au/. These
cases are discussed in §1.11.

§1.10. /u/.

The principal allophones of the Tagalog phoneme /u/ are (u) and (v}: respectively, upper-high-back
rounded and lower-high-back rounded. The allophone [u] is similar to the vowel that occurs as the first
clement of a diphthong in English ‘boot’ /buwt/ or ‘boo’ /buw/. The allophone [vu] is similar to the vowel

of English ‘put’ /put/.
A long /u/ is usually represented by the [u] allophone. Thus the [u] allophone is normal in words
like the following:

grupo {gru:poh/ ‘group’
krus /krurs/ ‘cross’
mura /musrah} ‘cheap’
sulat /surlat/ ‘letter’
tubig /tubig/ ‘water’

A short /u/ is usually represented by the [v] allophone. Thus the [v] allophone is normal in words
like the following:

lunsod flunso'd/ ‘city’
pula f{pula-h} ‘red’
sampu {sampu’/ ‘ten’
suklay fsuklary/ ‘comb’

Ju] is relatively rare in a phrase-final syllable, and occurs in this position principally in words of
foreign origin. In this position, short /u/, though normally represented by the[v] allophone, may be
represented by the [u) allophone if the phrase-final word is being emphasized. Some further examples of

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 13

fuf in a phrase-final syllable are:

konsul /kornsul/ ‘consul’
honeymoon {harnimun} ‘honeymoon’
naku {nakuhf ‘mother-o’-mine’
sandalwood {sarndalwud/ ‘sandalwood’

As was mentioned in $1.9, there is a certain amount of alternation between the phonemes /o/ and
fuf. The most important instances of alternation are those in which a word that normally has short /o/ in a
phrase-final syllable is used non-phrase-finally. Under these circumstances, /o/ is always replaced by /u/ if
the word is of native Tagalog origin. Thus the following words have /o/ in their final syllable if they appear
at the end of a phrase, but /u/ in their final syllable if they appear in the middle of a phrase:

ano fanoh{ ‘what?’ but ano pa J’anupah/ — ‘what else?’
opo Lo'po’} ‘yes, sir’ but oponga f’opurna’} ‘yes indeed, sir’
ulo furloh{ ‘head’ but ulo ko /wlukoh/ — ‘my head’

(Note that the change from /o/ to fu/ is not reflected in the conventional spelling. See § § 1.14 and
1.17 for the dropping of word-final /"/ and /h/ in the middle of a phrase, and §1.12 for the compensatory
vowel lengthening that accompanies the dropping of word-final /’/.)

In words of foreign origin that have short /o/ in their final syllable, when phrase-final /o/ alternates
freely with /u/ for most speakers in most cases when the word is used non-phrase-finally, Thus:

asbestos ba fasbesstos bah/ or fasbe-stus bah/ ‘asbestos?’
dialog ba /da'yalog bah/ or {daryalug bah/ ‘dialog?’
mascot ba /marskot bah/ or {marskut bah/ ‘mascot?’
pingpong ba /pitnpon bah/ or {pi*npun bah/ ‘pingpong?"

Sporadic replacement of short fof by short /u/ in a non-word-final syllable may also occur, but in
general short /o/ in this position is fairly stable. Replacement of short /o/ by short /u/ may thus occur
occasionally in words like the following,but the forms with /o/ are normal:

onorable fonora’bleh/ ‘honorable’
otomatik Potomartik/ ‘automatic’

There are also certain words in which short /o/ and short /u/ in a non-word-final syllable alternate
freely with one another. Thus:

biyolin {biyoli-n/ or /biyuli-n/ ‘violin’
doktrina /doktrnah/ or /duktrinah/ ‘doctrine’
tsuper itSoperr/ or {t8upe'r/ ‘chauffeur’

In addition to the cases of alternation between /o/ and /u/ already discussed, there are two other
cases that are discussed in subsequent sections: cases of alternation between the diphthongs /oy/ and /uy/,
to be discussed in §1.11; and cases of replacement of short /o/ by long /u/ as a result of the length-shifting
effect of certain suffixes, to be discussed in §1.12.

In spite of the many cases of alternation between /o/ and /u/, there is no doubt that the two are
distinct phonemes in Tagalog, since there are a number of pairs of words whose members differ from each
other only in that one has /o/ while the other has /u/. Example of such pairs are:

baboy /oarboy/ ‘pig’ babuy /ba-buy/ *pig-like person’
balot jbalot/ ‘wrapped’ balut /balut/ ‘duck’s egg”

bos /bors/ ‘boss’ bus /bus/ ‘bus’

botas /bortas/ ‘boots’ butas {burtas/ ‘hole’

hayop {haryop/ ‘animal’ hayup fharyup/ ‘animal-like person’
Poro /porroh/ (place name) puro {purroh/ ‘pure’

14 CHAPTER I

§1.11. Diphthongs.

As was stated in §1.5, a diphthong may be defined, for practical purposes, as a vowel followed by a
glide consonant in the same syllable. Tagalog has two glides, /y/ and /w/, which are presented in detail in
§1.21. After a vowel in the same syllable, /y/ represents a glide from the tongue and lip position of the
vowel to extreme high-front vowel position with spread lips, /w/ a glide to extreme high-back vowel
position with rounded lips. Diphthongs formed with /y/ are called FRONTING DIPHTHONGS; diphthongs
formed with /w/, BACKING DIPHTHONGS.

Tagalog has four fronting diphthongs: fey/, /ay/, /oy/, and /uy/. In most cases the vowels in these
diphthongs are short. Long vowels, however, occur in certain words of foreign origin: e.g.,

reyna fre-ynah/ ‘queen’

ice box f’arys barks/ ‘ice box’
boyfriend {boryfre-n(d)/ ‘boy friend”

Uy fury] (Chinese surname)

fey] is similar to the diphthong of English ‘bay’/bey. With a short vowel, /ey/ occurs primarily as an
alternant of /ay/, as explained below, but it also occurs as a primary diphthong in a few words of foreign
origin: e.g., Reynaldo {reyna'idoh/ (man’s name).

The diphthong /ay/ is similar to the diphthong of English by /bay/. /ey/ may occur as an alternant of
any short /ay/ which is not phrase-final. In rapid speech, /e:/ may also occur as an alternant of a short
non-phrase-final /ay/, Thus, while words like bahay ‘house’ or suklay ‘comb’ have /ay/ in their final syllable
if they occur at the end of a phrase, they may have either /ey/ or /e*/, as well as /ay/, in this syllable if they
occur in the middle of a phrase:

Phrase-Final Non-phrase-Final
bahay {barhay/ ‘house’ bahay ko {barhay koh/ ‘my house’
{bahey koh/
{barhe* koh/

suklay {suklay/ ‘comb’ suklay ko f{suklay koh/ ‘my comb*
{sukley koh/
{sukle* koh/

(In a limited number of cases, {if also occurs as an alternant of short non-phrase-final /ay/ in rapid
speech: thus, also /bathi koh/)

Since short /ay/ alternates with /ey/ and /e*/ in any non-phrase-final syllable, there are certain words
which always allow the alternation, either because the words never occur phrase-finally, or because the fay/
occurs in a non-final syllable of the word. Some examples are:

aywan Paywan}, /eywan/, /’e-wan/ ‘not known’

kay {kay/, /key/, /ke-/ (personal marker)
may imay/, /mey/, {me{ ‘have, there is’
mayroon /mayru’on/, /meyru'on/, /me-ru’on/ ‘have, there is’

In certain cases the diphthong /ay/ occurs as an alternant of the sequence /a’i/. The alternants /ey/
and /e*/ also occur in these cases. Thus:

kaibigan /ka’ibi:gan/, /kaybi-gan/, /keybi-gan/, /kebi-gan/ ‘friend’
kailan /ka’ilan/, /kaylan/, /keylan/, /ke*lan/ ‘when’

The Tagalog diphthong foy/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘boy’ /boy/. The Tagalog
diphthong /uy/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘buoy’ /buy/ (where this is differentiated from ‘boy’).
In Tagalog, phrase-final fuy/ occurs primarily as an emphatic alternant of foy/. There are, however, a few
words that have only /uy/, never /oy/, in a phrase-final syllable: eg., aruy /‘aruy/ ‘ouch’, babuy /ba-buy/
‘pig-like person’. (The last word contrasts minimally with baboy /ba-boy/ ‘pig’.)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 1S

Just as /uy/ is relatively rare in a phrase-final syllable, so /oy/ is relatively rare elsewhere, since, as was
explained in $1.10, an /o/ in the last syllable of a native Tagalog word is regularly replaced by /uj when the
word is not phrase-final. Thus:

amoy P’amoy/ ‘odor’ but amoy ba (’amuy bah/ ‘odor?*
kahoy {karhoy/ “wood” but kahoy ba {kachuy bah/ ‘wood?

Only in words borrowed from other languages may a word-final /oy/ be retained in the middle of a
phrase: e.g., cowboy ba /korboy bah/ ‘cowboy?’.

The Tagalog backing diphthongs are: fiw/, few/, /aw/, and /ow/. (/aw/ occurs with a long vowel in a
few words of foreign origin — e.g., loudspeaker flawdispi-ker/ — but is short in all other cases. fiw/, few),
and /ow/ always have short vowels.) Most dialects of English have no diphthongs that are similar to fiw/ or
few}. (fiw/ occurs, however, in Southeastern American English in certain words where other dialects have
lyuw/ or fuw/: ¢.g., ‘due’, ‘new’, and few/ occurs in some British dialects in words where other dialects
have fow/: ¢.g., ‘boat’, ‘no’.) In Tagalog, few/ occurs only as an optional alternant of /iw/ in a phrase-final
syllable, in some words, for some speakers. (See § 1.7 for a discussion of alternation between /i/ and fe/ ina
phrase-final syllable.) Thus some speakers pronounce words like sisiw ‘chick’ or baliw ‘crazy* with cither
fiw] or few} if they are phrase-final, but only with fiw/ if they occur elsewhere. Other speakers have fiw/ in
all cases.

The Tagalog diphthong faw/ is similar to the diphthong of English ‘brow’ /braw/. In a non-final
syllable, some speakers occasionally replace a short /aw/ by /ow/ or by the long vowel /o-/, in rapid speech.
(/ow/, which occurs in Tagalog only as an occasional alternant of faw/, is similar to the diphthong of
English ‘boat’ /bowt/.) Thus, sporadic pronunciations of, for example, ikaw ba ‘you?’ as /’ikow bah/ or
f‘iko-bah/ may be heard, in addition to the usual pronunciation /*ikaw bah/.

In many cases the diphthong /aw/ occurs as an alternant of the sequence /a°u/ in rapid speech. Ina
few such cases pronunciations with /o-/ or fow/ also occur: ¢.g.,

kaunti /ka’unti'/, /kawnti'/, /kownti'/, /kornti’} ‘a little
magsauli /magsa’uli’/, /magsawli’/, /magsowli’}, /magsoli’/ ‘return’

$1.12 Vowel length.

Vowel length, or duration, is significant in Tagalog. There are pairs of utterances that are
distinguished from one another on the basis of vowel length alone. Thus it is only the difference in the
length of the vowel of the second syllable that distinguishes the verb magnanakaw /magnasna*kaw/ ‘will rob’
from the noun magnanakaw /magnana-kaw ‘robber’,

Tagalog vowels are characterized by one of two degrees of significant relative length. The significantly
longer vowels may be called LONG VOWELS, the significantly shorter vowels may be called SHORT
VOWELS. (In the phonemic notation used in this book, long vowels are marked by a raised dot after the
vowel.) Every significantly long vowel of Tagalog may be explained as an instance of one of the three follow-
ing cases of vowel length: INHERENT LENGTH, COMPENSATORY LENGTH, or COALESCENCE
LENGTH. These cases are dealt with in tum below. Then the phenomena of NON-SIGNIFICANT
LENGTHENING and LENGTH SHIFT are discussed. (For a discussion of the relationship between
vowel length and stress, see § 1.29.)

By INHERENT LENGTH is meant vowel length that is present in a word regardless of the position of
the word in an utterance. In words of native Tagalog origin, inherently long vowels occur only in syllables
that are not word-final. Thus monosyllabic words of native Tagalog origin — e.g., the markers ang, sa, si,
etc, — never have inherently long vowels. The vowels of monosyllabic loan-words from English and Spanish,
on the other hand, are always inherently long. The following proper names, for example, have long vowels
regardless of their position in an utterance:

Bill {birlf Luz flurs}
Fe {ferh} Boy foory/
Bob {barb}

16 CHAPTER I

Final syllables of disyllabic or longer words of native origin never have inherently long vowels. Final
syllables of disyllabic or longer words from English (but not from Spanish) sometimes have inherently long
vowels in free alternation with short vowels. That is, the vowels of the final syllables of such words may be
either long or short if the words occur in the middle of a phrase. (This is in contrast to words of native
origin, all of which have only short vowels in their final syllables under these circumstances.) Some
examples are:

balloon ba /oalun bah/ or {balun bah/ “balloon?”
cartoon ba /kartu'n bah/{ or {kartun bah/ ‘cartoon?’

Tagalog has many pairs of words that differ from one another only in that one member of the pair
has an inherently long vowel in a non-final syllable while the other has a short vowel in this syllable. Some
examples are:

aso [asoh{ ‘smoke’
baga foagah/ vv

galing /galin/ “excellence”
lamang flaman/ — ‘advantage’*
Pito /pitoh{ ‘seven’

aso fasoh{ ‘dog’
baga foargah/ = ‘ember’
galing {gaslin/ ‘from’
lamang fla‘man{ ‘only’
pito {pittoh/ ‘whistle”

(The difference between the members of these pairs may also be described as a difference of stress,
the left-hand member of each pair being stressed on the first syllable, the right-hand member on the
second — sce §1.29.) :

By COMPENSATORY LENGTH is meant length that appears with the dropping of a consonant after
an otherwise short vowel. Certain cases of compensatory length have already been presented in
§1.11: namely, the long /e-{ and /o-/ that occur as alternants of diphthongs. The length of these
vowels ~— in, for example aywan ‘not known’, pronounced fe-wan/, and kaunti, ‘a little’, pronounced
/kornti’?/ — may be regarded as an instance of length compensating for the loss of a following glide
consonant.

Another, and still more frequent, case of compensatory lengthening is the lengthening of vowels in
word-final syllables that accompanies the loss of a following glottal stop in the middle of a phrase. (The
glottal-stop phoneme is not represented in conventional spelling, but is represented by the symbol /"/ in
phonemic transcriptions. See §1.14 for a general discussion of the phoneme.) Tagalog has a great many
words that end with a glottal stop: e.g.,

baba {barba’/ ‘chin’
hindi thindi’f ‘no’
luto flu-to’} ‘cooked*

When such words occur in the middle of a phrase, the glottal stop does not occur, but there is
compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the word-final syllable. Thus:

baba ba {ba-ba* bah/ ‘chin?’
hindi ba fhindi+ bah/ ‘no?’
luto ba flustu’bah/ ‘cooked?’

(As was noted in §1.10, /o/ in the final syllable of a word of native Tagalog origin is always replaced by /u/
if the word is used non-phrase-finally. Therefore /u-/ results from the compensatory lengthening of /o/, as
in the last example above.)

COALESCENCE LENGTH is length that is the product of the merging of two identical vowels that
have become contiguous as the result of the omission of a glottal stop. A glottal stop between vowels is
often omitted in normal rapid speech. The sentence Nasaan na ako? ‘Where am I now?’, for example, which
would have two intervocalic glottal stops in careful speech — /na’sa’an na ‘akoh/ — would normally lose
them both in rapid speech, and the contiguous identical vowels would coalesce into long vowels: /na’san

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 17

na‘koh/. As the above example shows, coalescence length may result from the merging of vowels cither
within a word (#asaan) or between two words (na ako).

In addition to the three types of significant vowel length just discussed, Tagalog also shows
NON-SIGNIFICANT LENGTHENING of the vowels of phrase-final syllables. All Tagalog vowels in
phrase-final syllables are phonetically long. This being the case, vowel length in a phrase-final syllable is not
significant — i.¢., there is no possibility of contrast between long and short vowels in this position — and
hence, in general, it is not marked in the phonemic transcriptions of this text. In phonetic transcriptions, on
the other hand, all vowels in phrase-final syllables are shown as long. Thus isa ‘onc’ is transcribed
phonemically /*isah/, phonetically [‘isath] , and apar ‘four’ is transcribed phonemically /’a-pat/, phonetically
{'apart]. (In phonemic transcriptions of phrase-final monosyllabic loan words, however, vowel length is
shown. As noted above, all monosyllabic loan words have inherently long vowels — i.e., vowels that are long
tegardless of the position in which the word occurs. While it is true that such length is not in itself
significant phrase-finally, there being no possibility of length contrast in this position, phrasc-final
monosyllabic loan words are nonetheless distinguished from phrase-final monosyllables of native Tagalog
origin by the way in which they are treated in lexically-determined two-point intonation patterns — see
§§1.23 and 1.25. In these patterns, phrase-final monosyllabic loans are given the treatment accorded other
syllables with significantly long vowels.)

By LENGTH SHIFT is meant the transfer of vowel length from one syllable of a word to another,

Length shift in Tagalog is associated with a number of different word-types — notably, verbs formed with
the two verbal suffixes —an and —in. (A VERBAL SUFFIX is a sequence of phonemes that is added toa
word to form a verb.) When either of these suffixes is added to a word that contains an inherently long
vowel, this vowel is normally shortened and the vowel in the following syllable is simultaneously
lengthened. For example:

tasa ftarsah/ ‘assessment’ > tasahan /tasachan/ ‘(to) assess”
pala /paclah/ ‘shovel’ > palahin /palathin/ ‘(to) shovel’

(Length shift does not occur in those few cases where the inherently long vowel is in a closed syllable, i.e., a
syllable ending in a consonant (cf. §1.22). Thus when the suffix —in is added to plantsa /plantsahj ‘iron’,
the resultant form, plantsahin {pla‘ntSahinj ‘(to) iron’, does not show length shift.)

There are certain changes of vowel quality that are associated with length shift. These changes
concern the lengthening of short /e/ and /o/. In certain specifiable cases, short /e/ is replaced by long /i-/,
and short /o/ by long /us/. In other specifiable cases, the original vowel quality is retained under length
shift. The condition that determines whether or not the vowel quality is retained is the quality of the vowel
that precedes the /e/ or/o/. If this preceding vowel is either /e/ or /o/, then fe/ is lengthened to /e-/ and /o/
to for}. If the preceding vowel is /if, /a/, or /u/, however, then fe/ is replaced by fi‘/ and fo/ by /u‘/.
Examples of the retention of vowel quality when the preceding vowel is /e/ or /o/ are:

kolorete /kolore-teh/ ‘rouge’ > koloretehan /koloretehan/ ‘rouge’
lote flotteh} ‘lot’ > lotehin /loteshin/ ‘(to) parcel”

belo /be-loh/ ‘veil’ + belohan /belorhan/ ‘(to) veil’

lobo /lorboh/ ‘balloon’ + lobohin /lobo-hin/ ‘(to) make into a balloon’

Examples of the change of vowel quality when the preceding vowel is /i/, /a/, or /u/ are:

tiket /tiket/ ‘ticket’ > tikitan /tiki-tan/ ‘(to) give a ticket’

dibate /dibateh/ ‘debate’ > dibatihin /dibati-hin/ ‘(to) debate with’
ule /‘u'leh/ ‘oilcloth’ > ulihan /‘uli-han/ ‘(to) put oilcloth on’

pino /pirnoh/ ‘fine’ > pinuhin /pinuchin/ ‘(to) make fine’

palo /paclo’/ ‘flogging’ > paluin /palu*in/ ‘(to) flog’

saludo /salu-doh/ ‘salute’ - saluduhan /saludu-han/ ‘(to) salute’

The two phonemes that appear on the chart in parentheses (/f/ and /13;) have a somewhat peculiar
status, for reasons to be explained in § § 1.17 and 1.18.

In §§1.14 through 1.21 the Tagalog consonant phonemes are taken up in groups that correspond to
the rows of Chart 5: /p, t, k, °/ in §1.14; /b, d, gf in §1.15; /m, n, n/ in $1.16; ff, s, hf in $1.17; fts/ in
§1.18; fif in § 1.19; frf in § 1.20; /y, w/in §1.21.

§1.14. Voiceless stops.

The Tagalog phonemes /p/, /t/, and /k/ differ from their English counterparts — the initial phonemes
of ‘pill’, ‘till’, and ‘kill’, for example — in several ways. In the first place, the English phonemes have
ASPIRATED allophones which occur at the beginning of stressed syllables, while the Tagalog phonemes are
UNASPIRATED in all positions. (An aspirated sound is one that is followed by a little [h]-like puff of
breath; an unaspirated sound is one that is not.) Unaspirated allophones of the voiceless stops do occur in
English, however, in certain other positions — ¢.g., after /s/, as in ‘spill’, ‘still’, ‘skill’ — and these allophones
are similar to the Tagalog sounds.

In addition to the consistent absence of aspiration, two of the Tagalog stops, /t/ and /k/, differ from
their English counterparts in point of articulation as well, Tagalog /t/ is dental, while English /t/ is alveolar.
(In American English, furthermore, /t/ is often voiced between vowels at the beginning of an unstressed
syllable, in which case it ceases to contrast with /d/. Thus many Americans pronounce ‘shutter’ and
‘shudder’, or ‘latter’ and ‘ladder’, identically. Tagalog /t/ is never voiced, regardless of its position in a word.
The /t/ of botas ‘boots’, for example, does not differ appreciably from the /t/ of tao ‘person’, and is quite

distinct from the /d/ of boda ‘wedding’.

The point of articulation of English /k/ varies noticeably according to the sound that follows it. The
{k/ of ‘keep’, for instance, is palatal, while that of ‘coop’ is velar. Tagalog /k/ does not show this kind of
variation. The /k/ of kiror ‘twinge’ and the /k/ of kuros ‘pinch’ are both velar. The point of articulation of

the Tagalog phoneme is, furthermore, usually somewhat further back than that of even the most retracted
allophone of English /k/.

Tagalog /k/ has a fricative allophone, which may be transcribed [x]. It is a velar fricative, identical
with Tagalog [k] in point of articulation, but differing from it in that sufficient space is left between the
back of the tongue and the velum for the air to escape with audible friction. The sound is similar to the
sound represented by cit in the conventional spelling of such German words as ach or Buch. In Tagalog, the
sound is a frequent substitute for [k] between vowels, especially between low and back vowels. In such
words as ako ‘I’, wakas ‘finish’, suka ‘vinegar’, nak *mother-o"-mine’, therefore, the f{ricative allophine is
quite common, as it is in phrases like Pupunta kami ‘We'll go’, where a word-initial /k/ becomes
intervocalic.

The glottal stop, [*], is a sound that occurs in English at the beginning of the second syllable of the
ejaculations ‘uh-uh* and ‘oh-oh’. In American English, it is also fairly common as an allophone of /t/ before

_a syllabic [n]: e.g.. in ‘cotton’ {ka’n]. (A consonant is said to be SYLLABIC when it is the most
prominent sound in a syllable.) Apart from its use in ejaculations and as an allophone of /t/, the glottal stop
occurs only sporadically in English, and it is not usually considered to be one of the English phonemes. In
Tagalog, on the other hand, /‘/ is as much a part of the phonemic system as any of the other consonant
phonemes, and is in contrast with other consonants at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of
words. Speakers of English are likely to substitute (k] for Tagalog /"/ in certain positions, and to omit the
sound altogether in others, especially in phrase-final position, where omission of {*/ is likely to be
interpreted by the Tagalog speaker as a use of the phoneme /h/ (see §1.17). The tendency to omit the
sound is reinforced by conventional spelling, in which it is not represented (sce §1.30). That neither
substitution nor omission is in general permissible is evident from such pairs of words as the following, in
which /*f contrasts with /k/, with /h/, or with absence of itself.

aso fasoh{ ‘dog’ kaso {karsoh} ‘case*

piit fpi'it) ‘imprison’ pikit {pikit/ ‘close (the eyes)’
paso /parso'f ‘burn’ pasok [parsok/ ‘entrance’

anay (anay/ ‘termite’ hanay fhanay/ ‘row’

kaon {ka’on/ ‘fetch’ kahon {kahon/ ‘box’

bata /barta'/ ‘child’ bata {bartah/ ‘bathrobe*
mag—alis /mag’alis/ ‘remove’ magalis {magalis/ ‘full of sores’

There are, however, certain cases in which /’/ is omissible, and other cases in which it is obligatorily
omitted, A word—initial /‘/ is optionally omitted when the word occurs in the middle of a phrase. Thus the
initial {*/ of a word like ano {’anoh/ ‘what’ is omissible when the word occurs in a phrase like sa ano ‘on
what’, which may be pronounced either /sa ’anoh/ or /sa‘noh/. (The long vowel in /sa-noh/ is an instance of
coalescence length resulting from the loss of an intervocalic glottal stop - cp. § 1.12.) A glottal stop
within a word, particularly between vowels, is also omissible. Thus saan ‘where’ may be pronounced cither
{sa’an] or {sanf.

Word-final {*/ is obligatorily omitted and is replaced by vowel length when the word occurs in the
middle of a phrase. Thus Mahaba ‘it’s long’ is phonemically /maha*ba‘/ while Mahaba ba ‘Is it long?” is
/maharba‘bah/ (cf. § 1.12).

All the Tagalog voiceless-stop phonemes have unreleased allophones which occur at the end of
phrases. (A final unreleased stop is one in which the air passage remains blocked until after the cessation of
the outward air-stream, with the result that the release, when it occurs, is inaudible.) In English too, final
voiceless stops are often unreleased, but the phenomenon is somewhat more general in Tagalog, so general
that an ordinary released (pJ, [t], or (k] at the end of a phrase sounds decidely non-Tagalog. (This
stricture does not apply to released final /*/, which is fairly common.) In place of the unreleased final
allophones of /p/, /t/, and /k/, NASALLY-RELEASED allophones sometimes occur as free alternants. (A
nasally-released stop is one in which, after the complete blockage of the air, the velum is lowered, allowing
the air to escape through the nose.) Further examples of the phonemes /p/, /t/, and /k/ are:

puto {putoh/ ‘bread’

tuto {tustoh/ ‘learn’

kuto {kurtoh/ ‘louse*

dapo {darpo’} ‘alight on*

dato {dartoh} (title of nobility)
dako {dako’} ‘place’

ulap fu'lap/ ‘cloud’

ulat fulah/ ‘report’

ulak Purlak/ ‘reel’

$1.15. Voiced stops.

Tagalog /b/, /d/, and /g/ are the voiced counterparts of /p/, /t/, and /k/ respectively, and have the
same points of articulation. Just as in the case of the voiceless stops, two of ‘the Tagalog voiced stops, /d/
and /g/, differ in point of articulation from the corresponding English phonemes. Tagalog /d/ is dental while
English /d/ is alveolar, and Tagalog /g/ is consistenly back-velar, while the point of articulation of English
{gf varies according to the following phoneme.

In final position, the voiced stops, like their voiceless counterparts, are either unreleased or nasally
released.

(There are many cases in which /d/ alternates with /r/ under certain specifiable conditions. Such cases
are dealt with in §1.20.)

Examples of the voiced stops follow:

balang {balan} ‘locust"

dalang {darlan} ‘slowness*

galang {garlan/ ‘respect’

Abad f'abad/ (surname)

agad f'agad/ ‘immediately”

edad fidad/ ‘age’

liyab flyab/ ‘flame*

liyag flyag/ ‘beloved’

liyad flyad/ ‘protrusion of the abdomen’

Some examples of contrasts between the voiced and the voiceless stops are:

basa {basa} wet" pasa {pasa} ‘bruise’
ambon fambon/ “drizzle” ampon fampon/ ‘adopt’
talukab ftaluekab/ ‘crab's shell’ talukap ftalukap/ ‘eyelid’
dakot {dakot{ handful" takot ftakot/ ‘frightened’
panday {panday/ ‘blacksmith’ pantay fpantay/ ‘even’
hilod fhirlod/ ‘scrub the body’ hilot frirlot/ ‘midwife’
gulang fgulan/ ‘age’ kulang {ku-lanf ‘lacking*
saglit {saglit/ ‘moment” saklit fsaklit/ ‘hook’
balag {ba-lagf ‘trellis’ balak foarlak/ ‘plan’

$1.16. Nasals.

Tagalog has three nasal phonemes, /m/, /n/, and {n/. The points of articulation of Tagalog {/m/ and /n/
are virtually identical with those of their English counterparts (the final sounds, for example, of ‘hum’ and
‘hung’). Tagalog /n/ is dental, while English /nj is alveolar.

All the Tagalog nasals may occur at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of words. Initial
Tagalog /n/ offers difficulties to the speaker of English, since the English velar nasal does not occur in this
position. In Tagalog, initial /n/ is quite common, as the following words show:

nga Ina’ ‘really’
nganga Inarna’] ‘betel’
ngakngak Inaknak/ ‘cry aloud’
ngipin {nivpin} “teeth?
nguni't /nuwnit/ ‘bu’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 21

Some further illustrations of the Tagalog nasals are:

Mayon /mayon{ (name of mountain)
nayon {naryon/ ‘town’

ngayon {nayon} ‘now’

sama fsamah} ‘accompanying’
sanay fsanay{ ‘experienced’

sanga f{sanah{ ‘branch’

kalam /kalam/ ‘churning of stomach’
kalan {kalan/ ‘stove’

kalang fkarlan/ ‘wedge’

In normal rapid conversation, word-final {nf and /n/ may undergo assimilation in certain cases.
(Assimilation is a process whereby a sound accommodates itself to a neighboring sound.) When a word that
ends in {nf is followed by a word that begins with a labial or labiodental consonant (/p/, /b/, /m/, or /f/),
Inf is often replaced by /m/. When a word that ends in {n/ is followed by a word that begins with a velar
consonant (/k/, /g/, or /n/), {nf is often replaced by /n/. Thus the word Sav /sanf ‘Saint’ tends to become
{sam or /sanf in contexts like the following:

San Pablo {sam pa’bloh/ “St, Paul’
San Blas /sam blars/ ‘St. Blas”
San Marco {sam ma:rkoh/ “St. Mark*
San Francisco {sam fransi*skoh/ ‘St. Francis’
San Carlos {san karrlos/ ‘St. Charles’
San Gabricl /san gabriyel/ ‘St. Gabricl"

Assimilation of /n/ takes place only in the cas¢ of certain prefixes and MARKERS, and in the case of
the LINKER -ng and the -ng form of the linker na/-ng. (Markers are defined in §2.4. The linkers -ng and
naf-ng are discussed in §§3.8 and 3.11 respectively.) Among the prefixes that show assimilation
are: mang-, pang-, and kasing-; among the markers, ang, ng {nan/, and kung. Assimilation is obligatory in
the case of the prefixes, optional in the case of the markers. In the case of the linkers, assimilation is
obligatory only if the two elements joined by a linker have coalesced into one word — c.g., the numbers
dalawampu {dalawampu’*} ‘twenty’ and dalawandaan /dalawanda‘an{ ‘two hundred’ (from dalawang pu and
dalawang daan respectively); otherwise, assimilation is optional.

Where assimilation of /n/ occurs, it consists of the replacement of /n/ by /m/ before /p/, /b/, /m/, or
{f}, by {nf before ftf, fd}, inf, fs/, M3, Af, fr/, or fy/ — in other words, /m/ before labial and labiodental
consonants, /n/ before dental, alveolar, and palatal consonants. The marker ang may be used to illustrate
the possible assimilations of /n/, ¢.g.:

ang pader fam pader/ “the wall’
ang bahay fam barhay/ ‘the house*
ang mangga fam mangah/ ‘the mango’
ang flu fam fluvh} ‘the flu’

ang tatay fan tartay} ‘the father’
ang damit fan damit} ‘the clothing”
ang nanay fan nasnay/ “the mother’
ang susi fan sursi’} ‘the key’
ang tsa fan Bath ‘the tea’
ang lapis fan larpis/ ‘the pencil’
ang reyna fan rerynah{ “the queen”
ang yoyo fan yoryo"/ ‘the yoyo’

As was mentioned in §1.5, vowels that precede nasal consonants are normally nasalized. Occasionally
in rapid conversation, a syllable-final nasal consonant may be omitted and the nasalization of the preceding
vowel retained as the only sign of the presence in the syllable of a nasal phoneme.

§1.17. Fricatives.

The phoneme /f/ is a relatively recent addition to the stock of Tagalog phonemes, and is not yet an
integral part of the phonemic system of all Tagalog speakers. There is no doubt, however, that the phoneme
is a part of the system here being described: educated Manila Tagalog (hereafter, EMT). Some speakers of
dialects other than EMT may have /p/ quite consistently in cases where EMT speakers have /f/, while others
may agree with EMT in having /f/.

The phoneme /f/ occurs only in words borrowed into Tagalog from other languages, notably Spanish
and English. In the case of borrowings from Spanish, all EMT speakers agree in retaining /f/ in the case of
personal names: e.g., Fe /feth/, Flora /Motah/, Fortunato /fortunastoh/. In the case of Spanish loan-words
other than personal names, there is less agreement. Some speakers retain the Spanish /f/ with great
consistency, others replace /f/ by /p/ with equal consistency, and still others use /f/ in some instances, /p/
in others, Some words in which both /f/ and /p/ are heard are:

Pilipino /filipirnoh{ or {pilipi-snoh/ ‘Filipino’
fresco {fre-skoh} or {preskoh/ ‘cool"
pamilya ffamislyah/ or {pamiclyah/ ‘family’
kape {kaferh{ or {kapesh/ ‘coffee’
telepono {tele-fonoh/ or fteleponoh/ ‘telephone*

In the case of borrowings from English, there is greater uniformity among EMT speakers, /f/ being
retained by most speakers in the majority of instances. Examples of such borrowings from English are:

formal (dress) {forrmalf

foxtrot ffarkstra‘t}
cafeteria {kafitesriyah/
refrigerator frefriedyere-ytor}
chief Giff

Like its English counterpart, the Tagalog phoneme /f/ has a single allophone: a labiodental voiceless
fricative.

Tagalog /s/ is, in most of its occurrences, similar to the /s/ of English ‘sing’, ‘sang’, ete.: the alveolar
fricative [s]. Before /y/, Tagalog /s/ has a PALATALIZED allophone [sY]. (A palatalized sound is one in
in addition to the main articulation of the sound, there is a raising of the front of the tongue toward the
hard palate.) This [s¥} is a sound that is intermediate between [s} and the sound represented by si (the
post-alveolar fricative [3]) in English words like ‘ship’ or ‘shop’. It occurs both in loan words and in native
Tagalog words. In loan words from English, the sequence /sy/(=)[s¥] replaces English /$/ at the beginnings
of words, Thus the following loan words have /sy/:

shop {syatp/
siyaperon {syaperon{ ‘chaperone’
shine fsyaryn}

Elsewhere, the usual replacement of English /8/ is /s/:¢.g.,

brush /bravs/
machine gun /masi-ngan!
marshmallow /marrsmaloh/

The sequence /sy/ also occurs in certain loan words from Spanish, ¢.g., siywdad {syudad} ‘city’.
At the beginning of native Tagalog words (but not of loan-words), the sequence /sy/([sYy] ) alternates
with the sequence /siy/ ([siy] ), some speakers preferring the /sy/ form, others the /siy/ form. Thus:

siya {syah/ or fsiyah/ ‘he/she*
siyam fsyam/ or {siyam/ ‘nine’
siyap fsyap{ or {siyap/ ‘chirp’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION

23

Since Tagalog has no sound like the sound represented by 2 in English ‘zero’ this sound is replaced by

{sf in borrowings from English, e.g.:

zero fse-roh}
zipper Jsi:per{
fuse Hyurs/
Rose fro-ws{
Some further illustrations of Tagalog /s/ are:
saan {sa’an] ‘where’
sino (sienoh/ ‘who’
aso [arsoh{ ‘dog”
bunso /bunso’/ ‘youngest child’
bigas fbigas/ ‘hulled rice’
ayos faryos/ ‘arrangement*

The glottal fricative, /h/, is, for practical purposes, equivalent to the English /hj of he or hat, The
Tagalog phoneme occurs not only at the beginning and in the middle of words but at the end as well. (In
the latter position, /h/ is not represented in conventional spelling; see § 1.30.) As was mentioned in §1.14,
Tagalog has pairs of words that differ from one another only in that one ends in /h/, the other in /’/.

Additional examples of such pairs are:

aba Pabahj ‘oh’ aba

baga /ba-gah/ ‘ember’ baga
tubo jtwboh} ‘tube’ tubo
yaya fyayah/ ‘nurse’ yaya

faba’ “miserable”
foarga’/ ‘lung’
/tubo'/ ‘growth’
lyarya’} ‘invitation’

Word-final /h/ is lost in the middle of a phrase. Thus: baga /ba-gah/ ‘ember’, but Baga ba? /barga bah}
‘(Is it) an ember?’ Before the suffixes -an and —in, however, final fhj is retained: punta {puntah/ ‘going’
puntahan {puntahan{ ‘go to’; sabi {sa*bih} ‘saying’ sabihin {sabirhin/ ‘say’. (It should be noted that, although
neither word-final fh/ nor word-final /’/ is retained in the middle of a phrase, the contrast between them is
preserved, /h/ being lost altogether, but /*/ being replaced by vowel length: thus /barga bah/ ‘(Is it) an

ember?’ versus /ba*ga+bah/ ‘(Is it) a lung?” ~ see §§ 1.12 and 1.14.)

Some further illustrations of /h/ are:

hayop /ha-yop/
hudyat fhudyat/
bahay foarhay/
mahirap {mahirap/
ama famah/
takbo ftakboh/

§1.18. Affricate.

‘animal’
‘sign’
‘house’
‘poor’
‘father’
‘running’

The alveolar affricate /13/ is similar to the English sound represented by cé in ‘church’. The sound
begins like the voiceless alveolar stop, [t], of English ‘top’ but the release of the closure is sufficiently slow
for the sound [8] (the voiceless post-alveolar fricative) to be briefly heard.

While the phoneme /ts/ occurs in the speech of perhaps the majority of EMT speakers, there are some
speakers who consistently use in its place the sequence /ty/ (dental [t] followed by [y]). Such speakers
pronounce the words in the following pairs identically, using /ty/ for both members of the pair:

.

tsa ‘tea
Chan (a surname)

tiyan

‘aunt’
‘belly’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
es

24 CHAPTER I

For speakers who have the phoneme /1%/, on the other hand, tsa and Chan begin with /13/, tiya and tiyan
with /ty/ or ftiy/.

(Speakers who use /t8/ in words like tsa and Chan use two alternative pronunciations for words like
tiya and ftiyan. They may either pronounce these words with the consonant sequence /ty/, or they may
insert the vowel /i/ between the /t/ and the /y/. Speakers who do not use /t8/ in tsa and Chan, on the other
hand, use only /ty/ (never /tiy/) in these words, as well as in fiy'a and fiyan.)

The phoneme /t3/ occurs chiefly in words of foreign origin: e.g., tsa (from Chinese), tsinelas ‘slippers’
(from Spanish) tsok ‘chalk’ (from English). Other examples of the phoneme are:

tsuper {tSuper/ ‘chauffeur’
intsik fintSik/ ‘Chinese’
kotse fkortSeh/ ‘car’
beach {oirt8/ “beach”
sandwich fsanwit8/ ‘sandwich’

(A few EMT speakers may use the consonant sequence /ts/ instead of the affricate /t8/, especially
between vowels. For these speakers, kotse is /kortsch/, with the /ts/ sequence pronounced just as it is ina
native Tagalog word like satsat /satsat/ ‘gossip’. The use of /ts/ instead of /18/ is, however, found principally
in dialects other than EMT, and most EMT speakers make a consistent distinction between the medial
consonants of Kotseh and satsat using /t$/ or /ty/ in the former, /ts/ in the latter.)

§1.19. Lateral.

Tagalog /lf has two allophones: an alveolar lateral, pronounced with the tongue tip against the
alveolar ridge, and a dental lateral, pronounced with the tongue tip against the inner surface of the upper
teeth, The dental allophone occurs only after the dental stops /t/ and /d/, as in tatlo ftatloh/ ‘three’, kidlat
{kidlat/ ‘lightning’; the alveolar allophone occurs elsewhere.

Tagalog /I/, whether alveolar or dental, is of the type called CLEAR [I] , a label used for an [!] sound
during which the blade and front of the tongue are raised toward the hard palate. American English /I/, on
the other hand, is normally of the type called DARK [I], a label used for an [I] sound during which the

back of the tongue is raised toward the velum. (In British English, and in some varieties of American
English, clear [1] occurs before a vowel in the same syllable, dark [I] elsewhere.)
Some further illustrations of Tagalog /I/ are:

lagi /largi’} ‘always’
Linggo /lingoh/ “Sunday”
malas /marlas/ ‘bad luck’
tuloy ftuloy/ ‘enter’
aral farralf ‘studying?
tahol ftahol/ ‘barking’

§1.20. Tap or Trill.

The most common allophone of Tagalog /r/ is the alveolar tap, [f]: a single rapid tap of the tip of
the tongue against the alveolar ridge. This sound is similar to a very rapidly released English [d], and is the
sound used by most Americans as an allophone of /d/ in a word like ‘shudder’, and as an allophone of /t/ in
a word like shurrer. The single tap is sometimes replaced by the alveolar trill, [r] , a series of rapid taps,
especially in emphatic speech.

Some illustrations of /r/ are:

rayuma frayurmah/ ‘rheumatism’
tipa {ritpah{ ‘lottery’

para {parrah} ‘for

sariwa {sari-wa"} ‘fresh’

bapor f{bapor/ ‘ship*

cantor {kantor/ ‘chanter’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 25

It is likely that {f] and [d] were once allophones of a single Tagalog phoneme. While there is no
doubt that the two sounds now belong to different phonemes (witness the contrast between such pairs of
words as maramdamin /maramdamin{ ‘sensitive’ and madamdamin {madamdamin{ ‘moving’), the earlier
status of the sounds is reflected in the existence of a great dal of alternation between the phonemes /r/ and
{d}. This alternation can best be understood on the assumption that /d/ is the basic phoneme in all cases
where there is alternation, and that it is replaced by /r/ under certain specifiable conditions.

The replacement of /d/ by {r/ typically occurs under either of two sets of circumstances: a /d/ at the
end of a BASE becomes intervocalic as a result of suffixation; or a /d/ at the beginning of a base becomes
intervocalic as a result of prefixation. (A base may be detined, for practical purposes, as a word that does
not include any affixes, or as the part of a word that remains when all affixes are removed.) The
replacement of /d/ by /r/ as a result of suffixation may be illustrated by the following:

lubid flurbidf ‘rope’ lubirin flubierin{ ‘be made into rope’
palad fpaladf ‘palm kapalaran /kapalatran/ ‘fate

tawad itawad/ ‘forgiveness’ patawarin {patawarrin/ ‘forgive’

tukod fturkod/ = ‘cane’ tukuran (tukurran/ ‘be used as a cane’

Replacement does not occur in the case of a few suffixed forms in which the vowel preceding the /d} is
elided; e.g., sundan {sundan/ ‘be followed’ (from sunod /sunod] ‘following’); masdan /masdan{ ‘observe’
(from masid fmasid/ ‘observation’). In a few other cases, two alternative suffixed forms occur, one in which
Jd} is replaced by /r/, another in which /d/ is retained and the vowel before it clided; ¢.g., neparin ftuparin{
or fupdin {tupdin] ‘be fulfilled’ (from tupad /tupad/ ‘fulfillment’).

Replacement of /d/ by /r/ as a result of prefixation is obligatory in the case of certain bases, In the
case of other bases, the replacement is optional, either /d/ or /r/ being acceptable. And in the case of still
others, /d/ is always retained. Illustrations of the obligatory replacement of /d/ by /r/ are:

dalita fdartita’} “poverty” maralita /mararlita’} ‘poor’
dapat {dapat} ‘should’ nararapat /nasrara‘pat} ‘proper’
dinig {dinig/ ‘hearing’ makarinig {makarinig/ ‘hear’

Illustrations of the optional replacement of /d/ by /r/ are:

marumi /marumih/
dumi /dumih/ “dirt” ‘dirty’
madumi /madumih/

marami /mararmih/
dami {daemih/ “quantity” ‘many’
madami /mada‘mih/

daragdagan /dasragdagan/
dagdagan /dagdagan/ ‘add’ ‘will add’
dadagdagan /dardagdagan/

Ilustrations of the retention of /d/ are:

dahon {darhon/ ‘lea? madahon /madahon{ ‘leafy’
dilim {dilim ‘darkness’ madilim /madilim} ‘dark’
duwag {duwag/ ‘cowardly’ naduwag {naduwag/ “turned coward”

There are six very common words — the four deictics dito, dine, diyan, doon, (see §3.4) and the two
enclitics, din and daw (see §6.4) — in which initial /d/ may be replaced by /r/ in the middle of a phrase.

This replacement may occur regardless of what precedes the word, but is particularly common after a
vowel,

26 CHAPTER 1

§1.21. Glides.

Tagalog has two glide phonemes, /y/ and /w/, each of which has two principal allophones, one
occurring before a vowel in the same syllable, the other after a vowel in the same syllable. Before vowels,
fy/ is a glide from the most extreme high-front-vowel tongue position, with lips spread, to the tongue and
lip position of the vowel. After vowels, /y/ is a glide to the extreme high-front-vowel tongue position, with
lips spread, from the position of the vowel. Similarly, /w/ is a glide either from or to the extreme
high-back-vowel tongue position, with lips rounded, according to whether it precedes or follows a vowel in
the same syllable.

Tagalog /y/ and /w/ differ from their English counterparts in that the English glides vary with the
adjacent vowels, a glide from a low vowel like /a/, for example, reaching a noticeably lower tongue-position
thana glide from a higher vowel. The Tagalog glides, on the other hand, always move from one or to one of
the extreme high-vowel positions.

(See §1.11 for a discussion of alternation between vowel-glide sequences and long vowels, and §}.22
for a discussion of alternation between consonant-/iy/ and consonant-/y/, and between consonant-/uw/ and
consonant-/w/.)

Illustrations of the Tagalog glides after vowels in the same syllable are given in §1.11. Some further
illustrations of the glides are:

yaya lyarya"} ‘invitation’

yeso lye*soh/ ‘chalk’

yinari lyinarri’/ ‘completed’

yoyo lyoryo"} ‘yoyo’

yumi lywmi’} ‘demureness’
wawa /warwa’/ ‘mouth of a river’
welga /werlgah/ ‘strike’

wika fwirka’} ‘language’
Wwumagayway /wumagayway/ ‘flutter’

§1.22. Syllable patterns.

This section is concerned with the permitted syllable patterns of Tagalog — or, more generally, with
the sequences of consonant and vowel phonemes that may occur. (When all permitted syllable patterns have
been described, all longer sequences of phonemes have necessarily been described as well, since polysyllabic
words and sentences always consist of sequences of permitted syllables.) A few definitions of terms precede
the presentation.

Every syllable contains a SYLLABIC. The syllabic is the most prominent phoneme of the syllable. A
syllable may also contain one or more other phonemes, which may be called NON-SYLLABIC.
Non-syllabics that precede the syllabic are called INITIAL; those that follow the syllabic are called FINAL.
A syllable that contains a final non-syllabic is a CLOSED SYLLABLE; a syllable that docs not contain a
final non-syllabic is an OPEN SYLLABLE. A sequence of two or more non-syllabic consonants occurring
within a syllable, either initially or finally, is called aCONSONANT CLUSTER.

The syllabic of a Tagalog syllable is always one of the five vowel phonemes: fi/, fe/, /a/, fof, /u/. The
vowel may be either long or short. (In words of native Tagalog origin, there are certain restrictions upon the
occurrence of long vowels, which are discussed below.)

In addition to the syllabic, every Tagalog syllable contains an initial non-syllabic consonant or
consonant cluster. Any one of the individual consonant phonemes of Tagalog may serve as an initial
non-syllabic. (Initial /*/ is not represented in conventional spelling: thus /’o*’oh/ ‘yes’ is spelled 00.) Initial
consonant clusters, however, are more severely restricted. No initial clusters of more than two consonants
occur, and within the group of two-consonant initial clusters the following restrictions are observable: the
second consonant of a cluster is always one of the four phonemes /y/, /w/, /r/, /I/; if the second consonant
is fy! or /w/, the first may be any of the following thirteen phonemes: six stops (/p/, /t/, /k/, /b/, /d/, /gf),
two nasals (/m/, /n/), three fricatives (/f/, /s/, /hf), /lf, and /r/; if the second consonant is /r/, the first may
be one of the same six stops, or /f/; if the second consonant is /I/, the first may be /p/, /k/, /o/, /g/, or /f/.
(The affricate ny —sce §1.18—is not classified as a consonant cluster because /¥f never occurs as a
separate phoneme in Tagalog.)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 27

In the case of the clusters formed with /y/ and /w/, there is a certain amount of variation between the
clusters themselves and sequences in which short fi/ and short /uf occur before the /y/ and the /w/
respectively: variation, that is, between consonant—/y/ and consonant—/iy/, and between consonant—/w/
and consonant—/uw/. Such variation is characteristic of many words of native Tagalog origin that have
initial consonant-glide clusters. The following are some examples of words in which most speakers allow the
variation:

biyak foyak/ or foiyak/ ‘broken’
tuwid {wid} or ftuwid/ ‘straight"
luwa flwa’/ or fluwa’/ ‘protruding”

When a vowel intervenes between a consonant and a glide, the vowel is syllable-final and the glide
syllable-initial, Thus the syllable division in words like biyak and tuwid, when the words are pronounced
foiyak/ and /tuwidj, is /bif—/yak/, /ww{—/wid/.

Certain other words of native Tagalog origin are pronounced by most speakers with an initial cluster
only, no variant with fiy/ or /uw/ occurring. (Note, however, that the words have conventional spellings in
which a vowel symbol appears between the initial consonant and the glide.) The following are some
examples:

diyan /dyan/ ‘there’
buwan /bwan} ‘month’
huwag /hwag/ ‘don’t?

In the case of words of foreign origin, there is little, if any, alternation between the clusters and the
consonant-vowel-glide sequences. For most speakers, such loan words from Spanish and English as the
following always have initial clusters. (Once more, however, the conventional spelling frequently includes a
vowel before the glide.)

piyano {pyanoh/ ‘piano*
biyernes /bye-rnes/ “Friday*
cute fkyut/ ‘cute’
tuwalya /twarlyah/ ‘towel’
duwende fdwendeh/ ‘dwarl

All phrase-final syllables in Tagalog are closed: that is, they contain a final non-syllabic. (Final /hf
and /"/ are not represented in conventional spelling: thus /nah/ ‘now’ is spelled na, and /na’/ ‘really’ is
spelled nga.) Non-phrase-final syllables may be either closed or open.

Any one of the individual consonant phonemes may occur as a final non-syllabic. (/h/ and /"/,
however, occur as final non-syllabics only in phrase-final syllables.) In general, final consonant clusters do
not occur in words of native Tagalog origin. (An exception is the /wn/ in the /kawnti’/ variant of Kaunti
fka‘unti’/ ‘a little’ — see §1.11.) A number of final consonant-clusters, however, are found in loan-words
from English, In some cases, such loan-words have alternative pronunciations in which one consonant of the
syllable-final cluster is not present: thus desk is either {de*sk/ or /des/, absene cither /*absent/ or /’arbsen/,
compact cither {ko-mpakt/ or /kormpak/.

Most of the final clusters that occur have fy/, /wf, /r/, or /If as their first phoneme (/y/ and /w/ in

these cases constituting the second element of a diphthong). Some examples are:

Some other final clusters that occur are presented below, with examples:

{ks/ ice box farys barks/ ins} allowance f{alaewans/
{k(t} compact /kormpak(t)f {nts branch fbrant3/
{ds} bridge [orieds/ ink! pink {pirnk/
int} tent {tent} /s(k)f desk [ders(k)/

In spite of the occurrence of a good many consonant clusters, both initial and final, the great
majority of Tagalog syllables consist of either two or three phonemes, the major patterns being either
consonant-vowel or consonant-vowel-consonant in a non-final syllable, and consonant-vowel-consonant in a
final syllable. With the use of the symbols C and V to represent any consonant phoneme and any vowel
phoneme respectively, these patterns may be expressed:

CV (non-final only)
cvc

(Certain markers ~¢.g., the plural marker mga /mana/ — apparently show a final CV pattern, Since,
however, these markers never occur in final position (except in citation), the CV syllables with which they
end may be regarded as non-final.)

There is an observable relation between syllable shape and vowel length in Tagalog. Specifically, it is
principally open syllables that have inherently long vowels, (See §1.12 for a discussion of inherent length.)
In the part of the vocabulary that is of native Tagalog origin, in fact, there are perhaps only two or three
instances, of inherently long vowels in closed syllables (e.g., nandito /nanditoh/ ‘is/are here’). In words
borrowed from English and Spanish, on the other hand, a good many instances of inherently long vowels in
closed syllables are met: e.g., bel /be*lf ‘bell’, Fernando {fernandoh/ (man’s name), Kendi /keendih/
‘candy’, Bivernes /bye*tnes{ ‘Friday’. But the preference for short vowels in closed syllables is reflected in
the pronunciation of certain loan words — particularly, early borrowings from Spanish — in which a vowel
that is stressed in the language of origin is short in the Tagalog borrowing. The first syllables of the
following words, for example, are stressed in their Spanish source, but in Tagalog have short vowels.

libro flibroh/ ‘book’
martes {martes/ ‘Tuesday’
gusto fgustoh} ‘like’

Just as there is a certain amount of observable patterning within the Tagalog syllable, so is there a
certain amount of patterning of syllable sequences within words. The bulk of Tagalog bases are disyllabic.
The shape of the first syllable of the base is usually one of the following:

cv as in dating {datin/ ‘arrival’
CV: as in tubig fturbig/ ‘water’
cvc as in isda Pisda’/ ‘fish’

The shape of the second syllable is usually CVC. The typical sequences of phonemes that occur in Tagalog
bases may therefore be expressed in the following formula:

cu { beve

c

There are, of course, bases that do not conform to this formula: those that have more or less than two
syllables, those that include syllable-initial and/or syllable-final consonant clusters, and loan-words with
inherent stress in closed syllables. The formula, however, probably covers somewhat over ninety percent of
all Tagalog bases.

Certain consonant sequences that do not occur within words may occur across word boundaries. In
particular, a sequence of two identical consonants may so occur, as in:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
30 CHAPTER I

masarap pala {masarap palah/ ‘oh, it's delicious’
lumabas sa... f{lumabas sa/ ‘went out from/to...’

(Phonetically, such sequences involve long consonants: [masarap‘alah}, [lymabasa].) In any such
sequence, one of the two identical consonants may be optionally deleted. Thus, also: /masarapalah/,

flumabasa/.)

§1.23. Intonation: introduction.

In Tagalog, as in English, part of the meaning of every utterance is conveyed by pitch phenomena. In
English, for example, an utterance may be understood as a statement or as a question, according to whether
there is a drop or a rise in pitch at the end: ¢.g.,

Statement: You told him.

a

Question: You told him?

(In the above examples and passim below, overlining is used to mark pitch levels: the higher the line, the
higher the relative pitch.) Similarly, the point in an English utterance at which a pitch change occurs can be
meaningful. A statement like ‘The man’s selling the table’, for instance, can be said so as to suggest such a
meaning as ‘the man, not the woman’, or ‘selling, not buying’, or ‘the table, not the chair’, according to the
point in the statement at which there is a rise and fall of pitch:

— Le

‘the man, not the woman’ The man’s selling the table.
‘selling, not buying” The man’s selling the table.
“the table, not the chair’ The man’s selling the table.

A meaningful pattern of pitches is called an INTONATION PATTERN. A stretch of utterance that
has an intonation pattern isan INTONATION PHRASE, or, simply, a PHRASE. The intonation patterns of
Tagalog phrases may conveniently be described in terms of three features: PITCH POINTS, PITCH
LEVELS, and PITCH CONTOURS. These features are discussed below in the order mentioned.

A PITCH POINT is a syllable at which relative pitch is significant: that is, a syllable at which the
speaker has a choice of pitches such that the meaning of the phrase is affected by the choice made. Some
Tagalog intonation patterns have only one pitch point, the INITIAL PITCH POINTS, or P, ; others have a

second pitch point as well, the FINAL PITCH POINTS, or P,. Patterns that have only P, are called
ONE-POINT PATTERNS; patterns that have both P, and P, are called TWO-POINT PATTERNS.

The position of P, varies according to the length of the vowels (see §1.12) at the beginning of the
intonation phrase, and according to whether the pattern taken by the phrase is a one-point or a two-point
pattern. In general, P, is the first syllable with a long vowel in the phrase (hereafter, the FIRST LONG
SYLLABLE). There are, however, several exceptions and partial exceptions to this generalization. In a
one-point-pattern phrase whose first syllable does not include a long vowel, P,; may be any syllable up to
and including the first long syllable —the preference being the first long syllable itself. In a
one-point-pattern phrase without long vowels, P; may be any early syllable of the phrase.

Syllables before P, may be slightly lower or slightly higher in pitch than P, or they may be on the
same level as P,. Since such variation is insignificant, it is hereafter assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that
syllables before P, are on the same level as P, itself,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION il

Beginning at P,, the pitch level of syllables is, in a one-point pattern, determined by the PITCH
CONTOUR (sce below). The following sentences would all normally take a one-point pattern (the /31/- see

$1.24, pattern L.1) with a high pitch on P, and a falling pitch contour beginning at P,. In the examples,
syllables that may serve as P, are italicalized.

=

Sino iyon? {sitnu yon/ ‘Who's that?*
Kanino iyon? {kani-nu yon/ ‘Whose is that?’

{kani‘nu yon!
Ano iyon? ‘anu yon{ ‘What's that?”

Janu yon{

—_._
fanu yon{

In a phrase that takes a two-point pattern, the placement of P, follows the rules already given, except
in cases where following these rules would make P, and P, coincide, or would place P, after P2. If, for
example, P2 is the next-to-last syllable of the phrase, and this syllable happens also to be the first Jong
syllable of the phrase, then P, must be some syllable before the first long syllable. There are also cases of
short phrases taking a two-point pattern in which the actual realization of the pattern lacks P, altogether.
This is the case, when, for example, a pattern in which P3 is the next-to-last syllable occurs in a phrase that
has only two syllables. The following sentences may all take a two-point pattern (the /31T/ pattern — sce
$1.27, pattern IV.4) with a high pitch on P,, a low pitch on the next-to-last syllable (P,), and a rise in
pitch after this syllable. (Syllables between P, and P, normally descend in pitch from P, itself — see
below.) Once more, syllables that may serve as P, are italicized:

LL

Tama ba? {tama bah/ “(Is it) right?”
Mabuti ba? {mabuti bah/ “(Is it) good?”
{maburti bah/

Mali ba? {mali bah/ ‘(Is it) wrong?’

a
Tama? {tarma’} “(Is it) right?”

(Note that in the next-to-last example, P, cannot be the first long syllable, since this is P2, and that in the
Jast example the realization of the pattern lacks P, altogether.)

For P,, location as well as relative pitch is significant. That is, the meaning of a phrase may be
affected by the placement of P, as well as by its pitch level. In some two-point patterns, called
LEXICALLY-DETERMINED PATTERNS, the position of P, depends upon the presence or absence of

Elements sous droits d'auteur
32 CHAPTER I

significantly long vowels (see §1.12) in the word(s) at the end of the phrase; in others, called FIXED
PATTERNS, P, is a syllable a fixed distance from the end of the phrase.
In lexically-determined patterns, the positioning of P is governed by the following rules:

1, P, is the phrase-final syllable if the last word of the
phrase is:
a. a polysyllable without a significantly long vowel;
b. a monosyllable other than a loan word, following a word without a significantly long
vowel,

we

P, is the last long syllable (i.e., the last syllable with a significantly long vowel) if the last word

of the phrase is:

a. a polysyllable with a significantly long vowel no more than three syllables from the end
of the word;

b. — a monosyllabic loan word*.

3. P, may be either the phrase-final syllable or the last long syllable in all other cases.

The cases covered by the above rules are illustrated in the following examples, which are numbered
according to the rule they illustrate. In two-point lexically-determined patterns ending with the words given
in the examples, P, would in each case be the italicized syllable(s).

la. damnit {damit} ‘clothing’
dumating {dumatin/ ‘came’

b. damit ko {damit koh/ ‘my clothing’
gulom na /gutum nah/ ‘hungry now’

2a. balloon /balun/ ‘balloon’
lapis fla:pis/ ‘pencil’
palatunfunan /palatuntusnan/ ‘program’
darating {darratin} ‘will come*

b. Kuya Bob {kurya barb/ *Big Brother Bob’
aking bel fakim beel/ ‘my bell”

3. sapatos ko /sapattus koh} ‘my shoe(s)’
mali na {mali¢nah/ ‘wrong now’
makakarating /makarkaratin/ ‘will be able to come’
nagsisipagsayaw {nagsiesipagsayaw/ ‘are dancing*

Fixed patterns are of one of two types: FINAL-P, PATTERNS and PREFINAL-P, PATTERNS. In
final-P, patterns, P, is always the phrase-final syllable. In prefinal—P, patterns, P, is always the next-to-last
syllable. If, therefore, the words just used for illustrating lexically-determined patterns were to occur in
fixed patterns, the position of P, would be as indicated by the italics below:

Final—P, Pattern Prefinal—P, Pattern
damit damit

dumating dwnating

damit ko damit ko

gutom na gufom na

balloon balloon

lapis lapis

palatuntunan palatunfenan

ete.

PRONUNCIATION 3

In two-point patterns, the pitch level of any syllables between P, and P2 varies according to the pitch
levels of P, and P, themselves. If P, is at a lower level than P,, there is usually a slight and gradual drop in
pitch on syllables between P, and P,. Less commonly but still quite frequently, there may simply be a
sustention of pitch at the level of P,. In the sentence Akin ba ang tinapay? ‘Is the bread mine?’ a two-point
pattern would normally be used, with P, the first syllable of the phrase, P, the next-to-last-syllable. The
syllables between the pitch points would either drop gradually from the level of P, or, less commonly,
remain on the level of P, . Thus:

Akin ba ang tinapay?
or Akin ba ang tinapay?

If P, is on a higher level than P,, the pitch may also drop or be sustained on syllables between P, and
P3, but there is the additional possibility of an anticipatory rise on a syllable or over several syllables before
P,. Thus the sentence Akin ang tinapay ‘The bread is mine’ (in which, once more P, is the first syllable, P2
the next-to-last), may be said:

kin ang tinapay.

as well as: Akin ang tinapay.

or: Akin ang tinapay.

If P, and P, are on the same level, there must be a drop on syllables between them. (There are only
two intonation patterns, the /334/ pattern and its free alternant, the /334/ pattern, in which P, and P, are
on the same level: see pattern II.1, §1.25).

In addition to the possibilities already mentioned, OPTIONAL PITCIL PROMINENCE may be given
to certain syllables between P, and P,. Syllables receiving such prominence are raised slightly above the
level of the syllables that surround them. Optional pitch prominence may occur at all, any, or none of its
potential points. These potential points themselves are lexically determined; they are the syllables that
would serve as P, were the words in which they occur to come at the end of a lexically-determined
two-point pattem. Thus in the following sentence, in which P, is the first syllable and P, the last, optional
pitch prominence may be given to any of the italicized syllables.

Darating ang dokéor sa bahay ni Juan bukas ng gabi.

‘The doctor is coming to Juan’s house tomorrow night.”

(The words with italicized syllables are, phonemically, /doktor/, /bathay/, /hwarn/, and /burkas/.)

At each pitch point, one of three distinctive PITCH LEVELS occurs. They may be designated HIGII,
MID, and LOW, and symbolized 3,2, and I respectively. These pitch levels are relative; their absolute value
varies from speaker to speaker, and, for a single speaker, from one utterance to another. Level 2 is
approximately at the middle of the individual speaker's normal pitch range for speech; levels 3 and | are
one or two notes above and below 2, respectively. The leave-taking formula Adyos ‘Goodbye’ is commonly
spoken with, the first syllable on pitch 2, the second starting on pitch 3, and then falling in pitch.
Thus: Adyos. (The pitch level at Py is, by convention, marked at the beginning of the intonation phrase,
although, in many cases, as noted above, P, is not actually the first syllable. The pitch level at P2 is marked
at the beginning of P, itself. Pitch contours — symbolized by arrows, etc., as explained below — are marked
at the end of the phrase.)

Ka] CHAPTER I

Four pitch levels have been ascribed to English: 4,3, 2, and 1. The English and Tagalog systems, may
be compared thus:

English Tagalog
4
3
3
2 2
1 {

In English, there is a distinction between high pitch (level 3) and extra-high pitch (level 4), the former
being used in normal, unemphatic speech, the latter being used when the speaker wishes to express
heightened emotion, or to give special emphasis to a particular word. Thus:

‘Don't do it.’ Don’t do it. (neutral)

“(I said) don’t do it.” (I said) don’t do it. (emphatic)

(The examples of the sentence ‘The man’s selling the table’ given earlier in this section, being instances of
contrast, use pitch 4 as the highest pitch. Spoken with pitch 3 on ‘table’ —

———L.

The man’s selling the table.

— the sentence is a neutral statement and does not imply a contrast like ‘the table, not the chair’.)
Although it is ordinarily true that other devices for emphasis or contrast accompany the use of pitch
4 in English — devices such as the use of extra loudness — it is nevertheless possible to keep two utterances
the same in all other respects, and still give them different meanings by the use of pitch 3 in one, pitch 4 in
the other. In Tagalog, the range for high pitch, or pitch 3, is somewhat wider than that for pitch 3 in

English; the use of an extra-high pitch does not necessarily modify the meaning of an utterance.
In Tagalog, as in English, there is a general tendency for the absolute value of pitch levels to become

gradually lower in the course of a single sentence. For example, the usual intonation of an English sentence
like ‘Peter, Richard, Robert, Philip, and Paul’, may be represented as follows:

———
ed sa r,t
Peter, Richard, Robert, Philip, and Paul.

Each intonation phrase in this sentence would normally be begun at a slightly lower absolute pitch
level than the phrase that precedes it. For purposes of describing the intonation patterns of English,
however, the pitch levels at the beginning of these phrases may be considered predictable variants of a single
distinctive pitch level, level 2. Similarly, in a Tagalog sentence like Si Pedro, si Ricardo, si Roberto, si
Felipe, at si Pablo ‘Pedro, Ricardo, Roberto, Felipe, and Pablo’, the pitch level at the beginning of each
phrase is describable as a predictable variant of pitch level 2, although in the actual phonetic realization of
the sentence the phrases might be begun at successively lower absolute pitch levels:

—_ -
er

—1.
Si Pedro, si Ricardo, si Roberto, si Felipe, at si Pablo.

The last pitch point of a phrase (P, in a one-point pattern, P2 in a two-point pattern) serves as a
reference point for one of four distinctive types of PITCH! CONTOURS. A pitch contour is the direction of
pitch that follows the last pitch point. While a pitch point is located at a single syllable, a contour may
extend over a range from a part of a syllable to, theoretically, any number of syllables. Tagalog has four
types of contours, which are symbolized: |, |, >, and ft.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 35

4 is a falling contour, starting from the pitch level at the last pitch point and dropping to the next
level or lower. lis also a falling contour, but the fall is not to so low a level as that reached by 4. 4 may be
called a FULL FALL; |,a HALF FALL.

The full fall is a drop of at least one full level; the half fall, a drop of less than one level. There is a
similar distinction in English between the full fall occurring at the end of most statements and commands
(e.g.2*Be careful!It's hot’), and the half fall occurring for example, in a mild admonition or warning (¢.g.,

Be careful”). The English full fall, however, differs from its Tagalog counterpart in at least one
respect: English | requires a greater degree of pitch change than does Tagalog {. As was stated above, the
Tagalog full fall requires a drop of at least one level; hence if the preceding pitch has level 3, the contour |
requires only a drop to level 2 (although the pitch may also go down to level 1). Thus, in the Tagalog
statement Babalik ako bukas ‘lll come back tomorrow’, the final syllable may be either on level 2 or level
1, with no change of meaning:

*Babalik ako’bukas?

*Babalik ako’bukas!

In English, on the other hand, a full fall always involves a drop to level 1. Thus ‘I'll come back tomorrow’ is
always:

farsi 3 1
“I'll come back tomorrow’.

In spite of the fact that the Tagalog full fall may represent a relatively slight drop in pitch, it is always
distinct from the half fall, which, in the example Babalik ako’bukas' represents a fall from level 3 to a level
about halfway to 2. The use of the half fall changes the meaning of the sentence from that of a complete
statement to that of a clause implying ‘more to come’: e.g. Babalik ako’bukas! (at mag-uusap tayong muli)
‘I'll come back tomorrow (and we'll talk some more)’.

The English half fall has a wider range than its Tagalog counterpart. It may cover a drop in pitch of as
much as one full level, as in the unfinished statement™I'm*sorry’, . .*, contrasting with the full fall in'I'm

sorry”! In Tagalog, a fall from 3 to 2 would be interpreted as an instance of the full fall rather than the half
fall.

The third Tagalog contour, symbolized > , is a sustention of the pitch level of the last pitch point,
and most commonly occurs in a non-sentence-final phrase: e.g.2Si Juan, si'Pedro,’si Marian at le wreueie ‘Juan,
Pedro, Maria,and....°

The fourth contour, symbolized ft, is a rise in pitch from the last pitch point. In Tagalog, as in
English, this is the type of contour that occurs at the end of yes-no questions (i.e., questions that can be
answered with 00 ‘yes’ or /tindi ‘no’ — see §7.4).

The phonetic realization of a pitch contour varies according to whether or not the last pitch point of
the phrase is the phrase-final syllable. If this is the case, the contour is realized within the phrase-final
syllable itself. Hence, in the unfinished statement Kung ganoon - ... ‘In that case...’ and in the complete
statement "Mabuti ang panahon ngayon" ‘The weather is good today’, the relative levels of pitch are as
indicated by the intonation lines below:

Kung ganoon...
Mabuti ang panahon ngayon,

If the last pitch point is not the phrase-final syllable, the contour starts on the syllable after the pitch point
and goes on to the end of the utterance. Thus, in the question’Sino ang dumarating?Who's coming?’ there

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

36 CHAPTER I

is a steady fall in pitch from the first syllable, which is P, of a one-point pattern, to the end of the

sentence:

Just as optional pitch-prominence can be given to certain syllables between P, and P, — see
above — so it can be given to certain syllables that are part of a pitch contour. The syllables that can receive
optional pitch prominence are, in both cases, those that would serve as P, were the words in which they
occur to come at the end of a phrase taking a lexically-determined two-point pattern. Thus, in the above
example, the second syllable of dumarating {dumarratin/ might be given optional pitch prominence, in
which case it would be slightly higher in pitch than the preceding syllable, and would be followed by an
immediate return to the falling contour.

Every intonation phrase is bounded by pauses. Pauses occur quite consistently at the end of major
grammatical units: e.g., clauses of certain types, and sentences. (The writing system of Tagalog, like that of
English, reflects the position of such pauses in the placement of punctuation marks like commas,
semicolons, colons, periods, question marks, exclamation points, etc.) Pauses of this kind may be called
OBLIGATORY PAUSES. Apart from obligatory pauses, utterances may include OPTIONAL PAUSES at
the boundaries of certain lesser grammatical units: e.g., the boundary between predicate and topic in basic
sentences (see §2.2). In general, the more deliberate or formal the style of speech used, the more numerous
are the optional pauses.

Certain generalizations can be made about the occurrence of optional pauses in Tagalog:

1. There is never a pause (other than a hesitation pause — i.e., a pause that occurs while the

speaker collects his thoughts) after an element that cannot occur in  sentence-final
position: e.g., ang, si, ng, ni, sa, kay, mga, ay, may, kung, the linker na/—-ng, etc.

2. There is never a pause (other than a hesitation pause) before an enclitic pronoun or particle (see
§§3.29 and 6.2 through 6.6), or between the members of a series of enclitics.

3. Optional pauses are most likely to occur at boundaries betwecn relatively independent sentence
components (¢.g., the predicate and the topic), less likely to occur at boundaries between
components in close syntactic and semantic relationships (e.g., the elements of a modification
construction — see §§3.11 ff.)

In the fotlowing sentences, places at which optional pauses may occur are marked by slant lines:

Nakita mo ba / si Maria { kahapon?
‘Did you see Maria yesterday?’

Bibigyan din sila / ng pagkain / sa bagong paaralan.
‘They will be given some food at the new school too’.

Magaganda raw / ang mga bulaklak / kung tag—ulan.
* They say that the flowers are beautiful in the rainy season’.

Kay Pedro / ang aklat / na nasa ibabaw / ng mesa.
‘The book on top of the table is Pedro's’.

The pauses indicated in these examples (particularly the second and third pauses in the last example) would
be likely to occur only in rather deliberate speech. The tendency in ordinary speech is to use few optional
Pauses, so that frequently each short sentence constitutes a single intonation phrase.

In the sections that follow, the presentation of the major intonation patterns of Tagalog is arranged
according to pattern types. One-point patterns are presented in §1.24, lexically-determined two-point
patterns in §1.25, final-P, patterns in §1.26, and prefinal-P, patterns in §1.27. §1.28 presents a
summary of the intonation patterns covered in §§1.24 through 1.27, arranged according to the sentence
and phrase types in which the patterns occur.

§1.24. One-point patterns,

In this and the immediately following sections, PATTERN FORMULAS are used to represent the
intonation patterns of Tagalog. In the case of the one-point patterns, each formula consists of a number
representing the pitch level at P, and a pitch-contour symbol. Thus the formula /34/ represents an
intonation pattern with high pitch at P, followed by a full fall.

The following are the major one-point patterns:

L1. /34/: used for:

a. non-emphatic commands (ef. §5.29);
b. information questions (cf. § §7.7 ff.);
c. replies with deleted elements;
d. __ initial topics or adverbs in yes-no questions with contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (2),
and §7.4).
Examples:

3 2
a. —~ Pumarito kat
‘Come here’,

*Tawagin mo si Carlos!
“Call Carlos”.

b. Sino ka ba?!
‘Who are you?’

*Kumusta po kayo?”
‘How are you, (sir/madam)’.
(Another pattern used for information questions is pattern 11.3, presented in § 1.26.)

3 4 4
c. —~ Nasa ibabaw ng mesa.
“On the table’. (In answer to, e.g., Nasaan ang libro ko? ‘Where’s my book?’)

7ang maliit’
‘The small one’, (In answer to, e.g., Ang alin ang mas gusto mo?
‘Which one do you prefer?"

d. ang bata ising ba?!
‘(How about) the baby — is it awake?"

3a kusina pithy martilyo?!
‘(How about) in the kitchen — is there a hammer (there)?”

1.2. /24/: used for:
a. __ the second part of alternative questions (cf. §7.5);
b. phrases of direct address after social formulas not in question form (cf. §7.22);
c. the sentence—final particle fa in sentences expressing sarcasm or a challenge to an assertion (cf.

§6.13).
d. quotation tags (cf. §3.28, subsection (1.d))
Examples:

a. 7Kukunin mo ba itd 3 hindi?!

“Are you going to take this or not?"

"Juan Cruz i 5 Juan Perez ang pangalan mo?

‘Is your name Juan Cruz or Juan Perez?’

direct address.)

3 Marunong Kaha?!
“You think you're smart, don’t you?’

"Hindi ka ba papasok? ha?!
‘So you're not going to school?*

‘He said, “Come here”.

2 Aalis ka na ba?” ng tanong niya!

“Are you leaving now?” he asked’.

1,3 /2t/: used for:

a. —_-yes-no questions (cf. §7.4), especially with deleted elements;
b. _ please-repeat questions (cf. $7.12);
c. the first part of alternative questions (cf. §7.5) and of confirmation questions with ano (cf.
87.6);
d. both parts of confirmation questions with hindi ba and diyata (cf. §7.6);
e. —_ non-sentence-final intonation.
f. the sentence-final particle ha in sentences expressing importunity (cf. §6.13);
g. the sentence-final particle o used as an attention-director (cf. §6.13).
Examples: t
a. Gusto ba ninyo?
‘Do you like it?”
Wala bat
‘Isn't there any?’
(In yes—no questions, the /2t/ pattern alternates with two other patterns: pattern III.3,
$1.26, and pattern 1V.4, § 1.27. See the discussion under the latter pattern.)
b. "anor
‘What (did you say)?” > 4
(cf. the information question Ano? ‘What (is it)?’)
*Sino (kamo) ang dumating?*
‘Who (did you say) arrived?’
c. For examples of the intonation of alternative questions and of confirmation questions with
ano, see patterns 1.2 above and 1.5 below, respectively.

d. *Galing sa Estados Unidos itd, hindi ba?!

‘This comes from the United States, doesn’t it?”

"Hindi bal ‘{aga-Albay ang ama ni Linda?"
‘Linda's father is from Albay, isn’t he?’

? Diyata, magkakilala kayo?!
‘Then you know one another?’
(When hindi ba is sentence—final, the initial clause may alternatively take a statement
intonation pattern such as /234/, pattern 11.2, §1.25.)

 
PRONUNCIATION 39

e. Asa pattern for non-sentence—final intonation /2t/ occurs with a wide variety of phrase
types: enumerations, sentence—initial phrases of direct address, non-final clauses, etc. Some
examples are:

*Si Rosai Pedrd si Ben’. avane
‘Rosa, Pedro, Ben....

‘ Hele? Halika rito!

‘Helen, come here’.

. Kung kailangan “tatawagin ko slyat
‘If necessary, I'll call him’.

, Sa Sabado’mamimili ako!
‘On Saturday, I°ll go shopping’.
(In its non-sentence—final uses, this pattern alternates freely with pattern [1.3, § 1.25. There is
also a contrastive non-final intonation pattern: pattern IV.2, §1.27. See also the discussion of
the intonation of phrases of direct address in § 1.28, subsection m1.)
f. Aalis ka na vl? ha?!
‘Well, are you leaving now?’ (Implication: ‘Do tell me*.)

*Hintayin mo nga akd? ha?!
‘Please wait for me, won’t you?"

>Diyan ka'ta?ha??
‘See you later, huh?"

(When, as in the last example, ha follows something other than a question or a request, the /2t/
pattern alternates freely with pattern 1.4, below.)

g. 7ayun si juarot!
‘Look, there’s Juan!"

*Basag ang paar!
‘Look, the glass is broken!”
(In this use, o may carry either the /2t/ pattern or pattern 1.5, below.)

‘And how much is this one?’

FE fayona
‘Well, let’s go’.

b. * Marunong ka- lia?

$6.13); ‘
c. the sentence-final particle o (cf. §6.13).
Examples:

a. *Maganda itd ise

‘This is beautiful, isn’t it?’
2 . ti =,
Nahuli ka kahapon, ‘ano?
“You were late yesterday, weren’t you?’

2
ce = Ayun si Juan,'o-
‘Look there’s Juan!”
*ayusin mo nga too"
‘How about fixing this, please’.

(When, as in the first sentence above, o is used as an attention-director, the /l-/ pattern alternates
freely with pattern 1.3, above.)

§1.25. Two-point patterns: lexically-determined.
Pattern formulas for lexically-determined two-point patterns consist of two numbers — the first

sepresenting the pitch level at P, the second the pitch level at P, — and a pitch-contour symbol. The
formula /234/ therefore represents an intonation pattern with mid pitch at P, and high pitch at P, (whose
position is lexically determined), ending in a full fall.

The major lexically-determined patterns are:

IL.1 /331/; used for follow-up statements, commands, and information questions.

Sentences in which this pattern is used are linked by logical relationship to a preceding utterance by
another speaker. For example, in response to a statement to the effect that the bus drivers are on strike,
one might say any of the following:

>Maglalakad 3ko!fakoh/
‘(Then) I'll walk’.

*Magdyip kayo! {kayoh/
‘(Then) take a jeep’.

*Paano tayo makarating sa palengke?'jpalexjkeh/
‘(Then) how shall we get to the market?’

(The examples of lexically-determined patterns given in this section are followed by phonemic

transcriptions of the last word(s) of the phrase taking the patterns. As was explained in § 1.23, the position
of P, in lexically-determined patterns is a function of vowel length and/or the number of syllables in the

Elements sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 41

phrase-final words.) The /334/ pattern is not used for follow-up requests or yes-no questions. In the above
context such responses as

Magdy ip nga kayo.
*(Then) please take a jeep’.

or

Makararating ba tayo sa palengke?
‘(Then) shall we get to the market?’

could not be spoken with the /334/ pattern.

(In addition to the lexically-determined /334/ pattern, there is a slightly more emphatic 334] pattern
with P, fixed on the last syllable. This pattern may, for practical purposes, be considered a free alternant of
the lexically determined pattern. It is not given further treatment in this presentation.)

(As was noted in §1.23, there is an obligatory drop in pitch on syllables between the pitch points of
the /334/ and /334/ patterns.)

(Another follow-up pattern, which suggests that the follow-up is self-evident, is pattern IV.2,
presented in $1.27.)

H1.2 /23)/: used for:

neutral statements;

citation pronunciations;

hortatives (cf. $5.29).

By a neutral statement is meant a statement whose intonation gives no indication of the
speaker's attitude toward what he says, or toward his audience, and in which there is no
suggestion of emphasis or contrast. (For the intonation of non-neutral statements, see § 1.26.

A citation is actually a particular kind of ncutral statement, a statement that consists of a word
mentioned as a word, rather than used as a linguistic symbol. A citation pronunciation is the
pronunciation given to a word so mentioned — the kind of pronunciation, for example, that
would be given to a word read from a word list, or spoken in answer to a question about how a
word is pronounced. Some examples are:

Zdumating’ /dumatin/ ‘came’
kahapon 4 /kaha‘pon/ ‘yesterday’

2 vod alt . ’

Saalis + *a-*alisf ‘will leave’

IL.3. /23-/ used for non-sentence-final intonation.
This pattern alternates freely with the /2t/ pattern — pattern 1.3, §1.24 — in the non-final uses of the
later. (The two patterns are, in fact, sometimes homophonous.) Examples of the {/23-/ pattern are:

><? Rosa, si Pedro, si Ben ...frorsah{, /pe-droh/, /be-n/
‘Rosa, Pedro, Ben...”

"Helen, halika rito}he-len/
‘Helen, come here’.

2 3 3
Kung kailangan, tatawagin ko siya {ka’ila-nan{
‘If necessary, PI call him.’

*5a°sabadomamimili 3ko/sabadoh/
‘On Saturday, I'll go shopping.’

(See §1.27, pattern IV.2, for a contrastive non-final pattern. See also the discussion of intonation in direct
address in § 1.28, subsection m.)

$1.26 Two-point patterns: final—P,.

Pattern formulas for fixed patterns with final-P, have an acute accent over the second number in the
formula; they are otherwise to be read like lexically-determined patterns. Thus the formula /234/ represents
an intonation pattern with mid pitch at P, and high pitch at (the beginning of) the phrase-final syllable,
followed by a full fall.

The major final-P, patterns are:

II.1, /231/: used for non-neutral utterances of various types.

This pattern has contrastive, expressive, and social uses.

In its contrastive use the pattern frequently occurs in statements and commands that are marked as
contrastive in some other way as well: e.g., by word order, as in the following examples:

2
Kay Juan ko ibinigay ang lapis.’
“L gave the pencil to Juan.’

"Kay Juan mo ibigay ang lapis.*
‘Give the pencil to Juan.’

Here the contrastive item, Kay Juan, is emphasized by its sentencc-initial position (cf. §7.2): cf. the
non-contrastive:

*tbinigay ko kay Juan ang lapis./la-pis/
‘I gave the pencil to Juan.’

*Ibigay mo kay Juan ang lapis.

‘Give the pencil to Juan.’

However, the contrastive meaning may be carried by the intonation alone, as in:

2 3
Lunes bukas.*
‘It’s Monday tomorrow.’ or ‘It's Monday tomorrow.”

Which im lies, a contradiction of some previous statement like *Linggo *bukas“'It’s Sunday tomorrow’ or
Lunes ngayon"'It’s Monday today.’

In Tagalog, the contrastive item (¢.g., Lunes ‘Monday’) is not singled out by pitch prominence the
way it is in the English contrastive pattern. (As pointed out above, one of the ways Tagalog singles out the
contrastive item is through word order.) The Tagalog contrastive intonation pattern signals the fact that the

 
PRONUNCIATION 43

utterance is contrastive to some other utterance, but it does not give an indication as to which specific
portion of the utterance is the carrier of the contrast. Where no other indication is present, the item that

carries the contrast can only be determined by context.
In its expressive uses, the /234/ pattern indicates strong fecling or emphasis, as in:

*Mabutit +
‘Good!’

* Mahuhulog ang bata!!
‘The baby’s going to fall!”

21 akad hat!
‘Go!

This use of the pattern is commonly accompanied by such other expressive features as an increase in
loudness, or a general raising of the pitch of the voice. The resulting utterance is, in effect, an exclamation,
and would be marked in writing by an exclamation point, as in the examples above.

In its social uses, the /234/ pattern indicates personal involvement in what is being said or cordiality
toward the person(s) addressed. As noted above (§1.25, pattern II.1), the lexically-determined /231/
pattern is neutral and gives no indication of the speaker's attitude toward what he is saying or toward his
audience. For this reason, the pattern is relatively rare in ordinary sociable conversation. (See, however, the
discussion of homophony below.) While a statement,like Eto, na si, Pedro ‘Here comes Pedro.’ may be said
either wj ith the lexically- determined /234/ pattern, (Eto na si Pedrah or with the fixed /234/ pattern (E10 na
Si Pedrd), the latter is more likely, since it shows — which is probably the case — that the speaker is
personally interested in the event. 1

In the case of a command receiving the pattern /234/ (as in Kumain na kay ‘Eat now’), the meaning
departs from that of a neutral command with a /31/ pattern (e.g., Kumain na kayd) either in the direction
of emphasis or in that of cordiality. The meaning of cordiality is also apparent in the frequent use of the
/231f pattern for social formulas not in question form. (Those in question form — like Kumusta po kayo?
‘How are you?’ — use the /34/ pattern of information questions.) (The lexically-determined /234/ pattern
sometimes replaces the /234/ pattern in social formulas used in addressing subordinates or intimates.)

Examples:

2 : 3
Marami pong salimat.*

‘Many thanks.’

; Magandang umaga.’

‘Good morning.’

(For the use of the /234/ pattern in requests of certain types, see the discussion under pattern IV.3,
§1.27; for the use of the pattern in hortatives, see the discussion under pattern II1.2, this section.)

The contrast between the neutral statement pattern, {234/, and the non-neutral pattern, 234, is
realized phonetically only in those cases in which the lexically-determined P, is not the phrase-final
syllable. When the phrase-final word is a polysyllable without significantly long vowels or a monosyllabic
loan word, the phonetic realizations of the two patterns are homophonous, since the /234/ pattern, as well
as the /234/ pattern, makes P, the phrase-final syllable in these circumstances. Note, for example, the
different results for utterances a and b below, ending in felen /he-len/ and Belen /belen/ respectively:

a. {234 * Maganda si Helen.!
‘Helen is beautiful.”
/234/ ? Maganda si Helen+
‘Helen is beautiful.’
b. /234/ ? Maganda si Belen!
‘Belen is beautiful.’
1234 *Maganda si Bélen.’

‘Belen is beautiful.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
“4 CHAPTER I

In the case of utterance a the difference between the intonation patterns is reflected in a difference in
the position of P,; in the case of utterance b, the two patterns have homophonous realizations. (Such
homophony is often eliminated in actual speech through the use of expressive features such as loudness or
gestures.)

1.2 /23-/: used for:

a. _ exclamations expressing negative attitudes (cf. §7.17);

b. _hortatives (cf. §5.29);

¢. statements and requests preceding the tag o (cf. 86.13);

d. emphatic requests with nga (cf. §5.30);

e. commands and social formulas preceding the tag ha (cf. §6.13).

a. — Being emphatic by nature, exclamations generally take the /231/ pattern described above
(pattern III.1).

Thus:

"ang laki ng iyong bahay!
‘How big your house is!”

However, for exclamations expressing negative attitudes, a sustained final contour is commonly used. Thus:

"ang init ng draw!
‘How (terribly) hot the sun is!”

*Kay haba-haba ng talumpati niya!
‘How long (and boring) his speech was!”

?Napakadumi naman nito!
‘How (disgustingly) dirty this is!’

b. __Hortative constructions (equivalent to English constructions with ‘Let’s’) take the /23-/
pattern when, as is usually the case, they are casual invitations to immediate or spontaneous

action.
For example:

*Tayo na.
‘Let’s go.’

*Tawagan natin si Hélen.
‘Let’s call Helen,”

2 : Sle 3 ¢
Huwag muna nating pitasin ang rosas.
Let’s not pick the roses yet.’

Three other patterns — /34/, /234/, and /234/ — also, but less frequently, occur with hortatives. The
/34/ pattern gives the hortative the force of a command; the /231/ pattern makes the hortative an invitation
to non-immediate or deliberate action; the /234/ pattern suggests urgency. Examples are:

Tayo na’
‘Let's go. (I insist)’

*Magmiting tayo bukas.!
“Let’s have a meeting tomorrow.’

*Umalis tayo!
‘Let’s get out of here!’

PRONUNCIATION 45

c. For examples of the intonation of statements and requests with the tag 9, see patterns 1.3 and
1.5, §1.24.

d. For examples of the use of the /23-/ pattern for emphatic requests with nga, see Pattern 1V.3,
§1.27.

(It may be noted that the phonetic realization of the /23>/ pattern is in some cases homophonous

with that of the [24] pattern — pattern 1.3 §1.24. Thus the /2t/ pattern in a question like Tayo ba?

‘Us?’ and the /23-/ pattern in a request like Tayo no ‘Let’s go,’ may have identical phonetic

realizations with respect to intonation:

—S-
Tayo ba?

a
Tayo na.

However, the two patterns have different ranges of phonetic realizations. In the /21/ pattern, while
the rise represented by /t/ may be only to level 3, it may be — and frequently is ~ to a higher level.
In the /23> pattern, on the other hand, the pitch level on the final syllable must be level 3. Thus the
question Tayo ba? may be realized as:

_—S

Tayo ba?

but the request Tayo na cannot be realized as:

7

Tayo na.)

32

2
e.  Hintayin mo ako, na
‘Wait for me, won't you?’

*Diyan kara tha? *
‘See you later, huh?’

11.3. /314/: used for:

a, —_- yes—no questions (cf. §7.4);

b. cordial information questions (cf. §7.7 ff.);

a. For the use of the /3it/ pattern in yes-no questions, see the discussion under pattern IV.4,
81.27.

b. The /3it/ pattern optionally replaces the /34/ pattern (pattern 1.1, §1.24) in information
questions in which the speaker wishes to express an attitude of particular cordiality or
deference. This replacement is not obligatory; that is, the use of the /34/ pattern in an
information question does not suggest any absence of cordiality. But the use of the /311/
pattern makes the cordiality explicit.

Examples are:

Ano po ba ang kailangan ninyo?
‘What do you need?’ (i.c., May I help you?’)

Kumusta ang tatay mo?
‘How’s your father?’

1.27 Two-point patterns: prefinal-P, .
Pattern formulas for fixed patterns with prefinal-P, have a grave accent over the second number in
the formula; they are otherwise to be read like lexically-determined patterns. Thus the formula /234/

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
46 CHAPTER I

represents an intonation pattern with mid pitch at P, and high pitch on the next-to-last syllable, followed
by a full fall.
The major prefinal-P, patterns are:

IV.1. /234/: used for statements ending in the sentence—final particles a and ¢ (cf. §6.13).
Examples:

3
7ayun (pala) sila, at
“But there they are!”

"Hindi na sila nakatira dobn, at

‘But they don’t live there any more.’

*Kulang ang pera ko, et

‘| did’nt have enough money, you see.”
2 3 of

Ikaw (nga) ang matalino, e.
‘On the contrary, you're the intelligent one.’

Note that, although the tags e and a are preceded by a comma in conventional writing, they form a
single intonation phrase with what precedes them.

IV.2, /23): used for:
a. _ follow-up statements and commands;
b. mild admonitions or warnings;
¢. — contrastive non-sentence- final intonation in statements.
a. The /23) pattern is used for responses in statement or command form that are assumed to
express something obvious or self-evident. Often such responses are preceded by di ‘why ... (of
course)’ or e, di ‘why then .. . (of course).’ Some examples are:

*(Di)*si Ben!

‘(Why,) Ben (of course).” (in response to, e.g., Sino ang kasama mo? ‘Who went with you?’)

Ea) magpahinga ka!
‘(Why then,) take a rest.’ (in response to, ¢.g., Pagod na pagod na ako. ‘I'm very tired.’

(A follow-up pattern with more general uses is the /334/ pattern — pattern II.1, §1.25.)
b. Examples:

*Mag-inigat ig Miinit!
“(You'd better) be careful. It’s hot.”

*Mag-aral kang mabuti!
‘(You'd better) study hard.”

The 123y pattern suggests that the admonition or warning is mild — sometimes even humerous.
Urgent warnings would normally take the {234/ pattern.
c. Asa pattern for non-final phrases, {23 generally connotes contrast, cither explicit or implied:

2s? Helen! inaiiwan dité Kami naman sasama kay Péurot

‘Helen will stay here. We'll go with Pedro.’

"Kung gusto ma, padadalhan kita ng képyat
‘If you wish, I’ll send you a copy.’ (‘Otherwise I won't.’)

 

Elements sous d'auteur

een eeee eee eee ee ees
PRONUNCIATION 47

In the first of the above examples, the contrastive character of si Helen and kami naman is indicated
not only by the intonation, but by word order in the first case and both word order and the
contrastive particle naman in the second. The contrastive /23) intonation is therefore redundant
here, and essentially the same meaning would be conveyed were another non-final intonation pattern
(/2t} or {23>/) to be used. In the second example, however, it is only the /23/ pattern that makes
kung gusto mo contrastive. Were the /2t/ or /23>/ pattern to be used in this case, there would be no
implication of contrast.

/23Y is also used as a non-final intonation pattern suggestive of a certain deliberateness of
thought. For example, in response to a question like Sino-sino ba ang nasa parti? ‘Who was at the
party?’ the answer

°5i Juanl, 8 Helen!’Si Pablo’, ..
‘Juan, Helen, Pablo...”

would suggest a deliberate effort at recollection. Or in a sentence like

2 3 2 3
Babalik ako bukas! at mag-uusap tayong rout!
‘I'll come back tomorrow, and we'll talk some more.”

The use of the /23¥ pattern for the first phrase conveys a suggestion of deliberate planning that
would be absent were another non-final pattern to be used.

IV.3. /33t/: used for non-emphatic requests with the enclitic particle nga (cf. §5.30).
Examples:

*Magluto ka nga ng kape!

‘Please make some coffee.”

*Pakitawag mo nga si'Rosa!
‘Please call Rosa.’

As was mentioned in §1.26, the /23-+/ pattern (pattern II1.2) is used for emphatic requests with nga.
Thus, suggesting urgency, cte:

*Tumalikod kanga!
‘Please turn around!”

Requests that do not include the enclitic particle nga normally take the /234/ pattern (number III.1,
$1.26):

*Magluto ka naman ng kape!

‘(Come now,) please make some coffee."

*Pakitawag mo si Résa.*
‘Please call Rosa.’

IV.4. /31t/ used for yes-no questions (cf. §7.4).
Example:

3 a
Para sa iyo ba ito?!
‘Is this for you?”

3 : seal
Darating ba siya bukas?"
‘Is he coming tomorrow?”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

48 CHAPTER I

. In yes-no questions with deleted elements, the /2t/ pattern (§1.24, number 1.3) is preferred to the
{31 tf pattern. Thus:

*Para sa iyo ba?*
‘For you?’

2
Bukas?*
‘Tomorrow?’

In questions without deletions, the reverse preference obtains.

The /31t/ pattern is occasionally used for please—repeat questions, the first part of alternative
questions, and confirmation questions with hindi ba, but the /2t/ pattern is commoner for questions of
these kinds.

A pattern with final P,, /3it/ (pattern 111.3, §1.26), alternates freely with the /3it/ pattern. Thus:

‘Para sa iyo ba ito?
Darating ba siya bukas?

(For some speakers, there is also alternation between /3)1/ and /32t/ — pattern 1V.2, present section — in
both questions and nga requests.)

Unlike statements, yes-no questions occur in no specifically emphatic or contrastive intonation
patterns. Emphasis or contrast in yes-no questions is indicated, if at all, by grammatical devices such as
change of word order, or by the use of expressive features.

1.28 Summary of intonation patterns.

The introduction of the major intonation patterns of Tagalog in §1.24 through 1.27 is organized on
the basis of pattern types: one-point patterns are presented in §1.24; two-point lexically-determined,
final-P, and prefinal-P, patterns are presented in §§1.25, 1.26, and 1.27 respectively. In the present
section the patterns are summarized according to the phrase and sentence types in which they occur. Chart
6 shows the order of presentation to be used. The first column of the chart enumerates the phrase and
sentence types to be dealt with, and assigns to each a letter; the second column lists, by pattern formulas,
the patterns that occur for each phrase or sentence type; the third column references the numbers assigned

to the patterns in the preceding presentation, and the section in which the presentation occurs. In the case
of sentence types that take a sequence of two intonation patterns, two pattern formulas connected by a

plus sign are given in the second column, and two number references in the third. Twelve phrase and
sentence types are listed on the chart, and assigned letters a through 1. [n the subsections given these letters
below, the patterns for each phrase and sentence type are illustrated in the order in which they are listed in
the second column of the chart. Then an additional subsection, lettered m, is devoted to a discussion and
exemplifications of the intonation of phrases of direct address.

(The intonation patterns of sentences with quotation tags (cf. §3.28, Subsection (1.d)) or with the
sentence-final particle ha (cf. §6.13) are not included in this summary, the patterns being too varied to
allow of convenient summarization. For examples of the intonation of sentences with quotation tags, see
pattern 1.2, §1.24; for examples of the intonation of sentences with sia see patterns 1.2 through 1.5,
§1.24.)

m. The intonation of a phrase of direct address in the middle of a sentence varies according to
whether or not the phrase occurs at a genuine phrase boundary: i.e., a point that would serve
as a boundary between intonation phrases were the direct-address phrase itself not present. If

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
54 CHAPTER I

the direct-address phrase occurs at such a boundary, two intonational treatments are
possible: one, the phrase may be given a separate non-final intonation:

*Kung gusto ninyd? "Inay,-pupunta ako!

‘If you like, Mother, I'll go.’ 1
(cf?Kung gusto ninyot} pupunta ako, )s

two, the direct-address phrase may be treated as part of a larger non-final intonation phrase,
with no pause before it:

*Kung gusto ninyo, Inay! pupunta ako!

If a direct-address phrase in the middle of a sentence does not occur at a genuine phrase
boundary — if, in other words, it occurs in the middle of what would, in its absence, constitute a single
intonation phrase — it is never given a separate intonation pattern, but is treated instead as an integral part
of the phrase into which it has been inserted, with no pauses separating it from the rest of this phrase.
Thus:

*Pupunta ba kayo, Inay, sa palengke?!
“Arg you going, Mother, to the mariel?
(cf. *Pupunta ba kayo sa pdlengke?)!

(Note that, in conventional writing, phrases of direct address are set off by commas whether or not they are
treated as separate intonation phrases.)

Sentence-finally, phrases of direct address may, in general, be given either of two intonational
treatments: they may echo the intonation pattern of the phrase that precedes them, or they may be
integrated into this pattern. Thus:

*Mabuti Teresi!
Mabuti, Tek
‘Good, Teresa!”

*Tayo na, Pedro”

*Tayo na, Pedro:
*Let’s go, Pedro.”

*Halika rite Helen!

*Halika rito, Helen.
‘Come here, Helen.”

t
sLumagda nga kayo” rita: Ginang’ Santos.
*Lumagda nga kayo rito, Ginang' Santos.
‘Please sign here, Mrs. Santos.”

‘ite, Binibining Reyes?!
"Ito, Binibining Reyes?
‘This one, Miss Reyes?”

The first of the above examples allows of another intonational possibility as well:

*Mabull” Teresa!”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
PRONUNCIATION 3s

This intonation is like the first given above, except that the falling contour before the phrase of direct
address is replaced by a sustained contour. Such a replacement may occur in the case of any two-point
falling contour that precedes a direct-address phrase. Thus:

*Magpatulong kayo sa kanila, Ginoong Cruz!

‘(Then) have them help you, Mr. Cruz.”

as well as:

sMagpatulong kayo sa kanilat "Ginoong Cruzt
*Magpatulong kayo sa kanila, Ginoong Cruz.

(The /334/ follow-up pattern ~ Pattern II.1, §1.25 — and the slightly more emphatic final-P, follow-up
pattern, /334/, do not occur as echo patterns for phrases of direct address. A direct-address phrase echoing
one of these patterns shows a lowering of P, to level 2, as in the above example.)

After social formulas not in question form, phrases of direct address allow of still another
intonational treatment, optionally taking a /24/ intonation pattern (pattern 1.2, § 1.24). Thus:

*Marami pong salainai, i Ginoong Magpayo!
*Marami pong salamat, Ginoong Magpayo.
‘Thank you very much, Mr. Magpayo.’

as well as:

jMarami pong salamat, ‘Ginoong Magpa of
jMarami pong salamat, *Ginoong Magpayo.
Marami pong salamat, Ginoong Magpayo.

§1.29 Stress.

Tagalog syllables show variation in stress, or relative prominence. Two degrees of stress may be
distinguished: strong, and weak. Syllables with strong stress may be called stressed; syllables with weak
stress may be called unstressed.

Stressed syllables in Tagalog are characterized by length prominence, by pitch prominence, or by
both. Unstressed syllables show neither length prominence nor pitch prominence.

Length prominence is prominence associated with the presence of a significantly long vowel in a
syllable. (See §1.12 for a discussion of significant vowel length.) All syllables that include significantly long
vowels are stressed, whether the significant vowel length is an instance of inherent length, of compensatory

length, or of coalescence length. In the sentence Sino po ba ang panganay? ‘Who is the eldest child?’,
pronounced as follows,

Ysi-nu pu: ban panarnayl,

there are four stressed syllables showing length prominence: /si-/, which has inherent length; /pu*/, which
has compensatory length (cf. the phrase-final form /po’/); /ba’n/, which has coalescence length (cf. the
uncoalesced form /ba ’a27/); and /na‘/, another instance of inherent length.

Pitch prominence is prominence associated with one of two kinds of pitch phenomena: a sise in pitch
at P2 of a two-point intonation pattern; or a rise in pitch ona syllable that is not a pitch point, followed by
a drop in pitch on the next syllable. The former may be called obligatory pitch prominence, since, given an
appropriate intonation pattern, it must occur; the latter may be called optional pitch prominence since,
given an appropriate intonation pattern, it may or may not occur. (Optional pitch prominence is discussed
in some detail in § 1.23, q.v., and is not discussed further in the present section.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
LN  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
$6 CHAPTER I

Obligatory pitch prominence is given to at most one syllable of an intonation phrase, and occurs only
in two-point patterns in which there is a rise at P,: e.g., /234/, /234/, /23-/. (In one-point patterns — e.g.,
/34/ — or in two-point patterns in which there is a drop at P, — ¢.g., /314/ — no syllable has obligatory
pitch prominence.) In the patterns in which it occurs, obligatory pitch prominence is given to the syllable
that serves as P2.

Obligatory pitch prominence in large measure determines word stress — i.e., the stress of syllables in
cited words. Since citation pronunciations always take the /234/ pattern (pattern 11.2, $1.25), pitch
prominence is always given to the lexically-determined P, of a cited word. In the following cited words,
pitch prominence is given to the italicized syllables:

danit “idatnit) ‘ ‘dress
maganda *magandahf ‘beautiful’
naira 3fmu- rah} 4 ‘cheap’

% 3, .
mahtusay {mahu‘say/ “good
darating fda‘ratin|* “vill come’
nag-aalis *nag’a’ ‘alis/ ‘remove(s)’

(In all but the first two of the above examples, pitch prominence coincides with length prominence.
The coincidence of the two types of prominence does not result in a degree of stress greater than that
characteristic of either type alone.)

While length prominence — at least length prominence given to inherently long vowels — is
independent of the position of a word in a phrase or of the intonation pattern used, obligatory pitch
prominence is entirely dependent upon them, Syllables that have pitch prominence but not length
prominence in cited words are therefore, in general, unstressed when the words occur in utterances in which
there is no P;, or in which P, is some other syllable. Thus the second syllable of damit /damit/ ‘dress,’
which has obligatory pitch prominence in citation, is unstressed in the following sentences:

Damit ba? "damit bah/* ‘(Is it) a dress?"
Damit ito. damit itoh/ 4 ‘This is a dress.’

On the other hand, syllables that have both pitch prominence and length prominence in cited words
retain stress in all contexts, since the length prominence remains even when the pitch prominence is lost.
Thus the first syllable of mura /mu‘rah/ ‘cheap,’ which has both pitch and length prominence in citation, is
stressed in the following sentences:

Mura ba? "mura bah/t ‘(Is it) cheap?”
Mura ito. "mura “ito! 4 ‘This is cheap.”

§1.30 Spelling and pronunciation.

Written Tagalog uses the same letters as does written English. The seven letters c, f,j,q, Vv, X, and z,
however, occur chiefly in proper nouns of foreign origin and in certain other borrowings from English or
Spanish; for example:

c Carlos (man’s name) q Quirino (family name) es
Cavite (place name) Quiapo (place name) '
camera ‘camera’ Quinina ‘quinine*

f Fe (woman's name) v Victor (man’s name)

San Felipe (place name) Vigan (place name)
mag-fishing ‘go fishing” vanilla ‘vanilla’

Neen eee eee es |<.

zipper

57

(man’s name) x Roxas (family name)
(place name) Alex (man's name)
‘jazz" tax ‘tax"

(woman’s name)
(place name)
‘zipper’

These seven letters are not included in the conventional Tagalog alphabet, which consists of twenty
letters, in the following order:

abkdefhilmnngoprstuwy

(Note that ng is conventionally considered a single letter.)

Tagalog spelling is very much more consistent than English spelling in reflecting pronunciation.
Except in the case of certain borrowed words, and in a few other cases to be noted below, each of the
above twenty letters is consistently used to represent a single phoneme, and each phoneme is consistently
represented by a single letter.

Two Tagalog phonemes, /n/ and /t3/, are conventionally symbolized by digraphs: mg and ts
respectively, as in:

bangko {ba:nkof ‘bank’ tsa Nahf ‘tea’
hanggang fhanga*n/ “until litser {ti Serf “teacher”
ngalan /nalan{ ‘name’ otso fo’ Soh ‘eight’

The phoneme /’} is not represented in conventional spelling (except in the spelling system proposed
by the Institute of National Language, a system that has not been generally adopted in popular Tagalog
writing). When /’/ occurs word-initially, however, its presence may be inferred from the conventional
spelling, which, in such cases, always begins with a vowel letter (a, e, i, 0, or u); for example:

asin Pasin{ “salt”

Ed fE-d/ (man’s name)
itim /itim/ “black”

oras forras/ ‘time’

utos [urtos/ ‘order’

When a syllable-initial glottal stop occurs after a prefix that ends in a consonant, a hyphen is placed after
the prefix:

‘remove’
‘going home’

/mag’alis/
{pag’uwi’/

mag-alis
pag-uwi

The phoneme /h/ is represented (by the letter h) only in syllable-initial position. Since ncither
word-final /’/ nor word-final /h/ is represented in conventional spelling, pairs of words that differ only in
that one of them ends in /"/ and the other in /h/, are spelled in the same way:

‘bathrobe’
‘nurse’

bata {bata} ‘child’ bata
yaya lyaya’/ ‘invitation’ yaya

{ba:tah/
fya'yah{

As was mentioned in §1.22, initial consonant clusters whose second element is /y/ or /w/ are usually
represented in conventional writing by consonant-iy and consonant-uw respectively, whether or not there is
actually alternation in pronunciation between /y/ and fiy/ or {w/ and fuw/:

‘month’
‘dwarf?

/bwa‘n}
/dwe-ndeh/

biyernes /bye'rmes/ ‘Friday’ buwan
Diyos fdyos/ ‘God’ duwende

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
58 CHAPTER 1

Conventional spelling normally reflects changes of vowel quality as a result of length shift in the
presence of the suffixes -an and -in (see § 1.12):

tiket /ti-ket/ ‘ticket’ —_— tikitan /tiki-tan/ ‘to give a ticket’
palo /pa‘lo’/ ‘flogging’ — paluin /palu’’in/ ‘to flog’

Changes of vowel quality under other circumstances (see §§1.7, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12) are not normally
reflected in the spelling. For example, the spellings Kayo and po are used consistently in the following
sentences, although kayo is /kayoh/ in the first sentence and /kayu/ in the second and third, while po is
/po / in the second sentence and /pu:/ in the third:

Kayo. /kayoh/ ‘You."
Kayo po. /kayu po’ ‘You, sir.’
Kayo po ba? /kayu pu’ bah/ ‘You, sir?"

Length is not indicated in conventional written Tagalog. Such pairs of words as the following are
therefore spelled identically:

bukas {oukas/ ‘tomorrow’ bukas foukas/ ‘open’
galing [ga‘lin/ ‘from’ galing /galin/ ‘excellence’

There are two very common words — the complement and possessive marker ng (cf. § $2.12, 2.14,

3.20, ete.) and the plural marker mga (cf. §§3.9 4.11, etc.) — whose conventional spelling does not reflect
their pronunciation. Ng represents /nan/; mga represents /mana/.

Basic Sentence Structure

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 59

§2.1. Introduction

This chapter outlines the grammatical structure of certain basic sentence types in Tagalog. The
sentence types whose structure is outlined are considered basic for two reasons: first, they are, in general,
the shortest and simplest types of complete sentences that occur in the language; second, the structure of
other, more complex, types of sentences may be described as resulting from particular elaborations or
combinations of elements from the basic sentence types. An example from English may serve to clarify this
second point. The sentences

John ate the apple.
Mary ate the pear.

may be considered representative of a certain basic type of English sentence. Once the grammatical
structure of this sentence type has been adequately described, the structure of the sentences

The apple was eaten by John.
The pear was eaten by Mary.

may be quite simply accounted for as a particular rearrangement of (and certain particular additions to) the
elements of the first set of sentences. Similarly, the structure of the sentences

John ate the apple and Mary ate the pear.
John ate the apple; Mary, the pear.

may be quite simply accounted for as particular combinations of these elements. Elements of the sentence
types considered basic serve, in short, as the building blocks with which the other sentence types of the
language are constructed. It follows that a description of the grammatical structure of the basic sentence
types will facilitate the description of the full range of sentence types that occur.

The outline of basic Tagalog sentence structures presented in this chapter is followed, in succeeding
chapters, by a more detailed examination of certain components of basic sentences. The outline itself
contains an ordered inventory of basic-sentence components, together with a preliminary discussion of the
internal structure of the components and the kinds of meanings they express. The inventory moves from
the more general to the more specific: that is, from the components that all Tagalog basic sentences have in
common, to those that distinguish the various types and subtypes of basic sentences from one another.

The structure of a basic sentence may be viewed as a branching diagram. For example, the structure
of the English basic sentence John loves Mary may be diagrammed as follows:

Basic Sentence

Subject Predicate

Verb y
Proper Noun Proper Noun
John Loves Mary

A diagram of this kind presents, as one moves from the top to the bottom, a number of progressively more
specific characterizations of the structure of the sentence. Thus the most general characterization of the
sentence above is that it is a basic sentence. Increasingly specific characterizations of the sentence, involving
progressively more refined and limited components, are:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
60 CHAPTER 2

a. Subject + Predicate

b. Subject + Verb + Object

c. Proper Noun + Verb + Proper Noun
d. John + loves + Mary

Characterizations b, c, and d distinguish John loves Mary from progressively larger groups of English
sentences. Thus while characterization a, Subject + Predicate, applies to a sentence like John ran,
characterization b, Subject + Verb + Object, does not; and, while characterization b applies to a sentence
like John ate the apple, characterization c, Proper Noun + Verb + Proper Noun, does not. Finally,
characterization d distinguishes John loves Mary from all the other sentences of English.

Branching diagrams of the kind just illustrated are used from time to time in the course of the
following presentation of Tagalog basic-sentence structure, both as a way of keeping track of the different
sentence structures under description and as a way of representing graphically the hierarchical relations
between the more general and the more specific components of basic sentences.

§2.2. The predicate-plus-topic structure.

The two most general components of Tagalog basic sentences — i.c., the two components that occur
in all such sentences -- are a PREDICATE and a TOPIC, which always appear in that order in basic
sentences (but may occur in the reverse order in certain non-basic sentences — cf. §7.2.) (Certain basic
sentences have a third component, an ADVERBIAL ~ cf. §2.17.) The topmost branching in a diagram of a
Tagalog basic sentence is therefore:

Basic Sentence

Predicate Topic

The topic expresses the focus of attention in the sentence. In many cases it corresponds to the subject
of an English sentence: ¢.g.,

Gumising ang bata. ‘The child awoke.”

Here the topic, ang bata ‘the child’, corresponds perfectly to the subject of the equivalent English sentence,
except for the fact that it follows, rather than precedes, the predicate.

But there are also many sentences in which a Tagalog topic is not translatable by an English subject,
and, conversely, in which an English subject is not translatable by a Tagalog topic. Thus the Tagalog
equivalent of the English sentence, ‘A noise awakened the child’, is

Ginising ng ingay ang bata.

In this sentence, the topic, ang bata ‘the child’, corresponds to the object of the English sentence, rather
than the subject, while the English subject ‘a noise’, is translated by ng ingay, which is part of the Tagalog
predicate.

One of the chief distinctions between the Tagalog topic and the English subject is that a topic never
expresses a meaning of indefiniteness, while a subject may or may not. Thus, in general, when the subject of
an English sentence includes an indefinite article (e.g., a, as in the previous example), it fails to correspond
to the topic of its Tagalog translation-equivalent.

A second important difference between a topic and a subject lies in the semantic relations that the
two have to a predicate verb. In the great majority of cases, the semantic relation of an English subject to
its verb is the relation of performer to action. There are conspicuous exceptions, such as the passive, but the
relation is valid often enough to have given rise to a generalization. In Tagalog, no such general semantic
relation obtains between topic and verb — witness the sentences:

Sinulat ko ang liham. ‘L wrote the letter.’
Sinulatan ko ang titser. ‘I wrote to the teacher.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 61

The performer of the action is, in both these sentences, expressed by Xo ‘I’, which is part of the predicate,
while each of the topics — ang liham ‘the letter’, ang titser ‘the teaches’ — is in a different semantic relation
to the verb. (The particular semantic relation of a topic to a verb is determined by the FOCUS of the
verb — cf. §2.9.)

While the topics of Tagalog sentences occur in a variety of semantic relations to verbs, they have in
common the fact that they express the focus of attention in the sentence. That is, cach topic represents an
object, person, idea, action, etc. that shares the attention of the speaker and his audience — something that
is focused on by the sender and the receiver(s) of the message alike. This common focus may originate in
any of a number of different ways. For example, the object, etc. may have been mentioned in the
immediately preceding context:

(Nagluto ng pagkain ang lola.) Masarap ang pagkain.
‘(Grandmother cooked some food.) The food was delicious.”

It may have been implied, rather than mentioned, in the preceding context:

(Punwnta sa Tagaytay ang klase.) Masaya ang biyahe.
‘(The class went to Tagaytay.) The trip was enjoyable.’

Or it may be something in sight:
Dumarating na ang bus. ‘The bus is coming now.”

The other component of a basic sentence, the predicate, represents what is said about the topic it
precedes. In general the predicate offers new information to the listener, representing some object, person,
idea, action, etc. that the speaker wants the listener to associate with the topic. While English predicates
always include a verb, Tagalog predicates need not. Tagalog predicates are of three types: NOMINAL,
ADJECTIVAL, and VERBAL; only the last of these includes a verb. Nominal, adjectival, and verbal
predicates are illustrated, in that order, in the following examples:

Artista ang babae. ‘The woman is an actress.’
Maganda ang babae. ‘The woman is beautiful.’
Yumaman ang babae. ‘The woman got rich.’

Tagalog sentences that include nominal or adjectival predicates may conveniently be grouped together
into a single class of EQUATIONAL SENTENCES; sentences that include verbal predicates may be called
NARRATIONAL SENTENCES. Tagalog cquational sentences differ from their English translation-equiv-
alents in the following principal ways: (1) the absence of a linking verb like English be; (2) the absence,
in the case of indefinite nominal predicates, of an indefinite article like English afan; (3) word order, the
Tagalog predicate being sentencc-initial, the English predicate sentence-final. The first of these differences
applies in all cases: the equivalent of be in Tagalog is simply the equational structure itself, the nominal or
adjectival predicate plus the topic. (An equational sentence may be translated with a present or a past form
of English be, according to the context.) The second of the differences docs not apply in the case of
adjectival predicates (or in the case of marked-nominal or definite predicates — cf. §2.4 for a discussion of
marked nominals, and §7.17 for a discussion of definitization of the predicate).

The third difference between Tagalog ecquational sentences and their English translation
equivalents — word order — exists in the case of all basic equational sentences. But Tagalog does have
certain non-basic sentence types, both equational and narrational, in which the topic precedes the predicate
(cf. §7.2).

Tagalog narrational sentences fail to correspond to their English translation-equivalents in a varicty of
ways, some of which have already been mentioned. The difference between English and Tagalog in the
order of the components of basic sentences obtains in the case of narrational, as in that of equational

sentences. And, as was noted above, the subject of an English narrational sentence frequently corresponds
to part of the Tagalog predicate.

62 CHAPTER 2

But even where there is considerable surface correspondence between a Tagalog narrational sentence
and its English counterpart, there is a fundamental, if subtle, difference between them. This difference has
to do with the status of verbs and nouns in the two languages. The distinction between verbs and nouns in
English is a basic and far-reaching one. English verbs and nouns occur in few, if any, of the same contexts.
Tagalog verbs and nouns, on the other hand, have many contexts in common. Not only can both nouns and
verbs serve as predicates, but there is virtually no context in which a noun occurs in which it cannot be
replaced by a verb or verb phrase. Thus, for example, a verb like yurmaman ‘got rich’ or a verb phrase like
nagluto ng pagkain ‘cooked some food’ may, like a noun, occur in topic position after ang: ¢.g.,

Artista ang yumaman.
‘The one who got rich is an actress.”

Artista ang nagluto ng pagkain.
‘The one who cooked some food is an actress.’

(Sentences like these are not considered basic sentences; they are dealt with in detail in §3.24.) As the
English translations show, English must add to or alter a verb or verb phrase in some way — ‘one who got
tich{/cooked some food’ — before it can serve as the subject of a sentence. Tagalog verbs and verb phrases,
on the other hand, may occur unaltered in topic position — and, in fact, in virtually any other position in
which nouns may occur.

Tagalog verbs and verb phrases are, then, much more noun-like than are their English counterparts. It
may, in fact, quite reasonably be argued that the distinction made above between equational and
narrational sentences in Tagalog is a somewhat arbitrary one, and that all Tagalog basic sentences, including
those here treated as narrational, are essentially equational in nature, involving a balancing of two
elements — the predicate and the topic — against one another. Thus a sentence like Guimising ang bata,
translated above as ‘The child awoke’, might be literally translated, to reveal its structure, ‘The child is
identified with a completed awakening’. That is, there is simply a balancing, as on a scale, of two equated
elements: ang bata ‘the child’ and gemising ‘awoke’. (Just how different this basic Tagalog sentence
structure is from English may be seen by observing that all English sentences, including the cquational ones
with be, are essentially narrational in structure. In English syntax, be is simply the verb that is used when
no other verb applies. Sentences such as ‘He is a man’, ‘Mary is an intelligent woman’, and so on, say no
more, logically, than ‘He/a man’, ‘Mary/an intelligent woman’, but to be a complete sentence at all, the
English sentence must contain a verb.)

While the distinction made in this presentation between equational and narrational sentences in
Tagalog is somewhat arbitrary, there are several reasons for making it. In the first place, verbal predicates
are distinguished from predicates of other kinds by the feature of ASPECT (cf. §2.7), which has a certain
limited correspondence to TENSE in some other languages. Secondly, verbal predicates are distinguished
from predicates of other kinds by the feature of FOCUS (cf.§2.10), which determines the semantic relation
between a verbal predicate and its topic. And finally, sentences with verbal predicates have an inherent
complexity that makes scparate treatment of them, if not mandatory, certainly convenient.

Since there are several kinds of nominal predicates (cf. §2.4), many kinds of adjectival predicates,
including adjective phrases (cf. §2.5), and an enormous complexity in verbal predicates (cf. § $2.6 through
2.15), it is clear that the core of Tagalog basic-sentence structure lies in the predicate. For this reason, and
because the predicate is normally sentence-initial, it is treated before the topic in the following discussion.

§2.3. Types of predicates.
As noted in §2.2, there are three distinct types of predicates. They are represented in the three
diagrams following:

BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 63

Basic Sentence

Predicate Topic
Nominal

Basic Sentence

Adjectival

Basic Sentence

Verbal

Each of these three types of predicates has further subclasses; each must be developed. They are alternative
choices, such that if the predicate is a nominal, it may not be an adjectival, if an adjectival, it may not be a
verbal, etc. Certain subclasses of adjectivals and verbals, however, include nominals as components, and it is
therefore convenient to present the nominal predicates first. This is done in §2.4. Adjectival predicates are
presented in §2.5, and verbal predicates in §2.6 through 2.15.

§2.4. Nominal predicates.

Tagalog nominals, whether serving as predicates or occurring in other sentence positions, may be
divided into two large classes: MARKED and UNMARKED. A marked nominal is a nominal whose
function in a sentence is always explicitly indicated in one of the two following ways: (1) by the form of
the nominal itself, or (2) by the form of a preceding MARKER. (A marker is a word that indicates the
grammatical function of another word or group of words.) Tagalog has three types of marked
nominals: PERSONAL PRONOUNS, DEICTIC PRONOUNS (sometimes called DEMONSTRATIVE
PRONOUNS), and PERSONAL NOUNS (in general, nouns that name specific persons). In the case of
personal and deictic pronouns, the function of the pronoun in the sentence is always marked by its own
form. In the case of personal nouns, the function of the noun in the sentence is always indicated by the
form of a preceding marker.

Tagalog has eight personal pronouns and four deictic pronouns. Each of these pronouns occurs in one
of three different forms according to its function in the sentence. (The preceding statement is a slight
oversimplification in the case of the second-person-singular pronoun and that of the composite pronoun
kita: cf. §3.3.) There are, of course, a great many personal nouns, but all are marked by a single set of
three markers, one for each of three different kinds of sentence functions. (For the pluralization of these
markers, cf. §3.9).

Complete lists of the forms of the deictic and personal pronouns are given in §§3.3 and 3.4
respectively. The personal-noun markers are summarized in §3.5. For present purposes, it is necessary to
present only the forms that occur in predicate-nominal position. These are:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
a). the following personal pronouns:

ako T kami —s‘T_ and others/we’

kata ‘you and I/we’ tayo = ‘you and I (and others)/we’

ikaw ‘you’ kayo = ‘you (and others)"

siya ‘he/she’ sila ‘he and others/she and others/they”

b). the following deictic pronouns:
ire ‘this’ iyan ‘that’
ito ‘this’ iyon “that”
(For meaning distinctions between ire and ito and between iyan and iyon, cf. §3.4).

c) the personal-noun marker si.

Some examples of basic sentences with marked nominals in predicate position are:

Siya ang Amerikano. ‘He’s the American.”
[yan ang bahay. ‘That's the house.”
Si Juan ang bunso. ‘Juan’s the youngest child.’

(Note that in the examples the marked-nominal predicate is translated by a subject in English. More precise
but more awkward English equivalents might be ‘The American is he’, etc. In any case, the Tagalog
sentences suggest contexts in which the predicates represent relatively new information — cf. §2.2).

All nominals other than personal and deictic pronouns and personal nouns are UNMARKED NOUNS.
The function in a sentence of an unmarked noun is never explicitly indicated by the form of the noun
itself, and is not always explicitly indicated by a preceding marker. Unmarked nouns do occur in many
constructions after function-indicating markers (e.g., after the marker ang in topic position — cf. §2.16),
but unlike personal nouns, unmarked nouns also occur in constructions without markers. One of these
constructions is the nominal predicate.

An unmarked noun in predicate position usually expresses one of two kinds of general meanings: ‘a
member of the class ” or ‘the class ”. These two kinds of meanings may be called INDEFINITE
and GENERIC respectively. In English, these meanings are normally expressed by the choice of the article
that precedes a noun or by the absence of an article before the noun: the articles a/an, and some are the
usual signs of the indefinite; the absence of an article is a frequent sign of the generic. Note the English
translations of the Tagalog unmarked-noun predicates in the following examples:

 

 

Isda ang bakalaw. ‘The cod is a fish.”
Isda ang pagkain niya. ‘His meal was some fish.”
Isda ang paborito niya. ‘His favorite is fish.’

§2.5. Adjectival predicates.

Adjectival predicates are cither ADJECTIVES or ADJECTIVE PHRASES. (The former are sometimes
referred to in the course of this text as ONE-WORD ADJECTIVES.) In both English and Tagalog, it is
sometimes difficult to decide whether a particular word is an adjective or a noun. For in both languages
adjectives and nouns occur in many of the same contexts. For example:

Bato ang bahay. ‘The house is stone.’
Bago ang bahay. ‘The house is new.”

In the first sentence, the predicate bato ‘stone’ is an unmarked noun; in the second, the predicate bago
‘new’ is an adjective. Yet there is apparently nothing in these sentences (or in the forms of the two words)
to justify such a distinction. The distinction is justified by the fact that there are certain other
constructions in which bago may occur but bato may not. Thus, for example, there is a sentence:

Elements sous droits d'auteur
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 65

Bagong-bago ang bahay. ‘The house is very new.”
but there is no:
*Batong-bato ang bahay. *The house is very stone.”

(An asterisk before a citation indicates ungrammaticalness.) In general, then, adjectives are distinguished
from nouns by their ability to occur in certain constructions in which nouns do not occur. (A number of
these constructions are dealt with in §4.12 through 4.16.) But there are still certain individual words, and
even certain whole classes of words (c.g., the CARDINAL NUMBERS — cf. §4.4), which are here
considered adjectives, but which might with equal justice be considered nouns, or possibly both adjectives
and nouns.

Apart from numbers, Tagalog adjectives fall into two main classes: ma- ADJECTIVES AND
UNAFFIXED ADJECTIVES, Ma- adjectives consist of the prefix ma- and ama- ADJECTIVE BASE. (The
ma- adjective base itself is often a noun.) Unaffixed adjectives, as the name suggests, have no prefix or
suffix. Both ma- ADJECTIVES AND UNAIFFIXED ADJECTIVES are divisible into further subclasses, and
there are in addition a number of minor adjective classes whose members are neither wa- nor unaffixed
adjectives. Details are presented in Chapter 4.

As was noted in §2.2, basic sentences with one-word-adjective predicates differ significantly from
their English counterparts only in word order and in the absence in Tagalog of a word equivalent to English
be. Some further examples of basic sentences with predicate adjectives are:

Mabuti ang panahon. ‘The weather is good.”
Matamis ang kendi. ‘(The) candy is sweet.’
Pagod ang bata. ‘The child is tired.”

The English counterparts of Tagalog sentences with adjective-phrase predicates often include a form
of be plus a prepositional phrase: ¢.g.,

Nasa kusina ang mesa. ‘The table is in the kitchen.’
Para sa bata ang laruan. ‘The toy is for the child.’
Tungkol sa giyera ang kuwento. ‘The story is about the war.’

In some cases, however, the English counterparts include some verb other than be: ¢.g.,

May gulayan ang babae. ‘The woman has a vegetable garden.”
Kailangan ko ang kuwalta. ‘I need the money.”
Sa istudyante ang libro. ‘The book belongs to the student.’

What distinguishes these adjective-phrase predicates from genuine verbal predicates is the fact that they are
not marked for ASPECT (cf. §2.7). That is, they are not susceptible to variations in form correlated with
variations in tense-like meaning.

Tagalog has a good many different types of adjective phrases, the details of which are presented in
§4.17 through 4.23. In these sections, certain single words that have semantic and distributional similarities
to adjective phrases — rather than, say, to ma- adjectives or unaffixed adjectives— are dealt with together
with the phrases they resemble. (Thus, for example, locative deictics like narito ‘here’ and naroon ‘There®
are dealt with together with locative phrases like nasa kusina ‘in the kitchen’.

§2.6. Verbal predicates.

All Tagalog verbal constructions include a verb: a word that is capable of INFLECTION to indicate
aspect. (By INFLECTION is meant systematic changes in the form of words correlated with systematic
changes in meaning. Most English nouns, for example, are capable of inflection to indicate
number: ‘boy/boys’, ‘man/men’, etc. Aspect is defined in §2.7.) In addition to the verb, many Tagalog
verbal constructions include one or more COMPLEMENTS. A verb that accepts a complement in a basic
sentence is called a TRANSITIVE VERB; a verb that does not accept a complement in a basic sentence is

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
66 CHAPTER 2

called an INTRANSITIVE VERB. (The terms transitive and intransitive are applied somewhat differently in
the case of DERIVED VERBS: verbs that occur only in derived sentences — cf. §5.1.) A transitive verb in a
basic sentence always precedes its complement(s).

The verb itself, whether transitive or intransitive, has two components: its aspect and the BASIC
FORM of the verb. The following diagrams show the structure of basic narrational sentences as summarized
thus far:

Basic Sentence Basic Sentence
“| Topic Predicate Topic
Verbal Verbal
Transitive Comptement(s) Intransitive
Verb Verb
Aspect Basic Aspect Basic
Form Form

§2.7. Aspect.

The Tagalog verb system includes no true tense distinctions like the English distinction between past
and non-past: past as in ‘He lived in Manila’, ‘He worked too hard’, ‘He left this morning’; non-past
(present, habitual, or anticipated) as in ‘He lives in Manila’, ‘He works too hard’, ‘He leaves this morning’.
This English tense distinction, by means of which events are expressed as cither limited or not limited to
some time before the moment of speaking, has no genuine parallel in Tagalog.

But the English verb system makes certain other distinctions that do have Tagalog parallels: e.g., the
distinction between events viewed as completed — ‘He walked down the street’ — and those viewed as
on-going — ‘He was walking down the street’. This type of distinction is a distinction of aspect.

For purposes of describing the Tagalog verb system, aspect may be defined as the characterization of
an event as completed or not completed, and, if not completed, as begun or not begun. All Tagalog verbs
are inflectable for three aspects: PERFECTIVE, IMPERFECTIVE, and CONTEMPLATED. The perfective
aspect characterizes an event as completed, the imperfective as not completed but begun, and the
contemplated as not begun. (Some verbs also occur in the RECENT PERFECTIVE aspect, which
characterizes an event as recently completed. Recent perfective formations do not occur in basic sentences,
and are discussed in §5.23.) Since these three aspects are not associated with a tense system
(past/non-past), no one-to-one correspondences with English tense/aspect formations obtain. Each of the
Tagalog aspects has several English equivalents. The closest equivalent in any case depends upon the
semantic and structural context in which the verb occurs.

English has at least three different tense-aspect formations that may be used to report events as
completed. One is the simple past, as in ‘Mother cooked some food’. The second is the so-called present
perfect, as in ‘Mother has cooked some food’. And the third is the so-called past perfect, as in ‘Mother had
cooked some food (when I arrived)’. The Tagalog counterpart of all three of these formations is the
perfective aspect — plus, in the case of the counterparts of the English present perfect and past perfect, the
enclitic particle na (cf. §6.3):
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 67

Nagluto ng pagkain ang nanay.

‘Mother cooked some food.’

Nagluto na ng pagkain ang nanay.
‘Mother has cooked some food.”

Nagluto na ng pagkain ang nanay (noong dumating ako).
‘Mother had cooked some food (when I arrived).”

English also has at least three different tense-aspect formations for reporting events as begun but not
completed. If the event is recurrent, English uses the simple non-past: ‘Mother cooks some food every day’.
On-going events are represented by the non-past progressive or the past progressive: ‘Mother is cooking
some food’; ‘Mother was cooking some food’. All three of these formations correspond to the Tagalog
imperfective aspect:

Nagluluto ng pagkain ang nanay araw-araw.
‘Mother cooks some food every day.”

Nagluluto (na) ng pagkain ang nanay.
“Mother is cooking some food (now).”

Nagluluto ng pagkain ang nanay (noong dumating ako).
‘Mother was cooking some food (when I arrived).

For reporting an event as not yet begun, English uses one of a number of non-past
formations: ‘Mother cooks/is cooking/will cook some food tomorrow’, The Tagalog counterpart of these
various formations is the contemplated aspect:

Magluluto ng pagkain ang nanay bukas.
‘Mother will cook (etc.) some food tomorrow.’

In addition to the correspondences already discussed between Tagalog aspect formations and English
tense—-aspect formations, there are certain others that are dealt with in connection with the particular
constructions to which they are relevant (e.g., the correspondence dealt with in §6.3 between the Tagalog
imperfective and the English present perfect with ‘not yet”:

Hindi pa nagluluto ng pagkain ang nanay.
‘Mother has not cooked any food yet.’)

The already-discussed correspondences are summarized below:

“had cooked’
nagluto (perfective) “has cooked’
“cooked”

“was cooking’

‘is cooking’ nagluluto (imperfective)
magluluto (contemplated) ‘cooks’

‘will cook’

The forms that mark the three aspects are set forth in detail in §§5.19 through 5.22. The forms
differ according to the affix of the basic form of the verb. (Each basic form consists of an AFFIX and a
BASE —cf. §2.8.) But certain features are quite consistently present. For example, the sign of
incompleteness (which characterizes both the imperfective and the contemplated aspects) is

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
RSS SS nnn

68 CHAPTER 2

duplication: normally, prefixing of the first consonant and first vowel of the verb base to the base itself.
Thus the imperfective nagleluto and the contemplated magluluto both show the duplicating syllable he
(/lu:/) before the base duto (/lu‘to/), while the perfective nagluto lacks this syllable. Similarly, the two
aspects that report events as having been begun (i.c., the imperfective and the perfective) are both marked,
in most cases, by an affix that includes the phoneme /n/: thus, the begun nagluluto and nagluto versus the
not-begun magluluto.

In summary, the aspect branch of a verb (transitive or intransitive) is developed in one of three ways:

Verb Verb Verb
Aspect Basic Form Aspéct Basic Form Aspéct Basic Form
Perfective Imperfective Contemplated

§2.8. Basic Forms.

As was stated in §2.6, the second component of a verb (either transitive or intransitive) is a BASIC
FORM. The basic form itself has two components: an affix — or, more precisely, the basic form of a
affix — and a verb BASE. Thus:

Verb

Aspect Basic Form

Affix ase

The arrangement of aspect, affix, and base in the branching diagram above does not necessarily
represent the sequence in which these elements occur in an actual verb form. As was noted in §2.7, the
aspect may be signaled by a duplicating syllable that comes immediately before the base, by a change in the
form of the affix, etc. Furthermore, the affix and the base may occur in any of three different order
relations, according to whether the affix is a PREFIX, an INFIX, or a SUFFIX.

In basic forms, a prefix precedes a base, an infix follows the first consonant of a base, and a suffix
follows the entire base. For example, the prefix mag- precedes the base bakasyon ‘vacation’ in the basic
form magbakasyon ‘have a vacation’; the infix -wm- follows the first consonant of the base liwanag
‘clearness’ in the basic form dumiwanag ‘become clear’; and the suffix -in follows the base kalawang ‘rust’ in
the basic form kalawangin ‘get rusty’. Note that the placement of the hyphen is used to indicate the
position of the affix in relation to the base: a hyphen after the affix indicates that the affix is a prefix and
precedes the base; hyphens on both sides of the affix indicate that the affix is an infix and is surrounded by
the base; a hyphen before the affix indicates that the affix is a suffix and follows the base.

(When a base begins with a glottal stop, /’/, the position of an infix after the first consonant is not
reflected in conventional spelling, since the glottal stop itself is not symbolized. Thus with a base like alis
falis/ ‘departure’, the infix -uz- forms a basic form that is spelled umalis ‘depart’, and the spelling does not
reveal the infixing process, although a phonemic respelling — /’umalis/ — does.)

Certain affixes, which may be called COMPLEX AFFIXES, consist of two or more distinct
components, one of which may, for example, be a prefix and another a suffix. Thus the basic form
pagsulatan ‘write on’ contains, in addition to the base sulat ‘writing’, the prefix pag- and the suffix -an.
Such affixes are written with three dots separating the components: ¢.g., pag-... -ai.

It is convenient to refer to verbs formed with a given affix by labels such as mag- verb (i.c., a verb
formed with mag-), -nt verb (i.e., a verb formed with -wt-), -in verb (i.e., a verb formed with i), etc. Such
labels are used in this text primarily with reference to basic forms. Thus magbakasyon is a mag- verb
because its basic form includes mag-. Similarly, the aspect-marked forms of verbs are sometimes referred to
by such formulas as ‘the imperfective form of a mag- verb’, ‘the contemplated form of an -wm- verb’, ‘the
perfective form of an -in verb’, etc.

BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 69

Of the many verbal affixes that occur in Tagalog, only a rather small subset occur in basic sentences.
The affixes that do occur in basic sentences may be called MAJOR AFFIXES; the other affixes, DERIVED
AFFIXES, (Verbs formed with major affixes are MAJOR VERBS; those formed with derived affixes,
DERIVED VERBS. For a detailed treatment of the major affixes, cf. §5.2. The derived affixes — which, in
general, may be predicted as occurring or not occurring with a given base once it is known what major
affix(es) the base accepts — are presented in § §5.8 through 5.16.)

The second component of a basic form, the base, is the part that expresses the core of meaning of the
verb. This core of meaning is in some cases a particular type of activity or movement. For example, ‘upward
motion’ is expressed by the base akyat, which occurs in basic forms such as wnakyat ‘climb’ and mag-akyat
‘move (something) upward’. In other cases, the core of meaning is a concrete entity (object, person, etc.)
involved in the actions or events expressed by the basic form. Thus anak ‘child, offspring’ is the base of
such basic forms as manganak ‘give birth’, and ipanganak ‘be born’. Or the core of meaning may be an
abstract quality: e.g., ganda ‘beauty’, which occurs as the base of such basic forms as gumanda ‘become
beautiful’ and gandahan ‘beautify’.

As the above examples show, a single base may be common to a number of different basic forms.
These basic forms are differentiated from one another by the affixes with which the base occurs. There is
no general rule for determining the affixes — at least, the major affixes -- that a given base accepts. There
are, however, relatively few major affixes, and they group themselves into certain sets, each member of
which is accepted by the same bases. A base that occurs with a particular set of major affixes is said to
belong to a particular AFFIX-CORRESPONDENCE CLASS. Many bases belong to more than one such
class — that is, occur with more than one set of major affixes. Affix-correspondence classes are introduced
in §2.12, and presented in detail in § §5.3 through 5.5.

§2.9. Focus.

As was mentioned in §2.2, FOCUS is the feature of a verbal predicate that determines the semantic
relationship between a predicate verb and its topic. This feature of verbal predicates is associated with the
verbal affix. Certain affixes, for example, characteristically form verbs that occur with topics that express
the performer of the action while others characteristically form verbs that occur with topics that express
the goal of the action. Thus -unt verbs normally occur with topics that express the performer of the action,
-in verbs with topics that express the goal of the action: e.g.,

Bumabasa ng diyaryo ang titser.
‘The teacher is reading a newspaper.”

Binabasa ng titser ang diyaryo.
‘The teacher is reading the newspaper.’

In the first sentence, the topic ang titser ‘the teacher’, which expresses the performer of the action, is
selected by the -unr verb bumasa (imperfective: bumabasa). In the second sentence, the topic ang diyaryo
‘the newspaper’, which expresses the goal of the action, is selected by the -in verb basahin
(imperfective: binabasa — the suffix -in does not appear in imperfective or perfective forms of -in
verbs: cf. § §5.20 and 5.21).

While all verbs, both transitive and intransitive, may be said to have focus, the focus of intransitive

verbs, at least in basic sentences, shows relatively little variation. Most major intransitive verbs
(i.e.,intransitive verbs that occur in basic sentences) select topics that express the performer of the action:

Naghihilik ang lolo.
‘Grandfather is snoring.’

Humihinga pa ang pasyente.
‘The patient is still breathing.”

There arc, however, certain major intransitive verbs that are essentially non-actional in character (e.g., wa-
and -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ — see §5.6, classes ¢ and b):

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
70 CHAPTER 2

Nauuhaw ang sanggol.
‘The baby is getting thirsty.”

Tumatanda ang aso.
‘The dog is growing old.”

In the case of these verbs, it is difficult to decide on the appropriate interpretation of the semantic relation
between the topic and the verb. But the correspondence of topic to performer in basic sentences with
intransitive verbs as predictes is sufficiently widespread to permit a generalization to the effect that such
intransitive verbs are normally ACTOR-FOCUS: i.c., select as topic the performer of the action of the
verb.

No such generalization can be made in the case of major transitive verbs. While many of the transitive
verbs that occur in basic sentences are actor-focus, an equal or greater number of such verbs select as topic
something other than the performer of the action. Any verb that does not focus upon the actor may be
called a GOAL-FOCUS verb.

Tagalog has at least eight different classes of goal-focus verbs. That is, the topic of a Tagalog sentence
may be in any one of at least eight different kinds of semantic relation to the verb, apart from that of
performer to action. Only two of these classes of goal-focus verbs, however, are found in basic sentences.
These two classes are OBJECT- FOCUS verbs and DIRECTIONAL-FOCUS verbs.

The distinction between object-focus and directional-focus is in some cases closely matched by the
distinction made between direct and indirect objects in English. In such cases, the object-focus verb focuses
upon (i.e., selects as topic) the equivalent of the English direct object, while the directional-focus verb

focuses upon the equivalent of the English indirect object: e.g.,

Ibinigay ng titser sa istudyante ang premyo.
‘The teacher gave the student the prize.”

Binigyan ng titser ng premyo and istudyante.
‘The teacher gave the student a prize.’

In the first example, ibinigay is object-focus, and selects as topic the equivalent of the English direct object,
ang premyo ‘the prize’. In the second example, binigyan is directional-focus, and selects as topic the
equivalent of the English indirect object, ang istudyante ‘the student’.

When, however, only a single direct object occurs in the English equivalent of a goal-focus basic
sentence, the verb in the Tagalog sentence is not invariably object-focus. For, although there are many cases
of object-focus verbs that select as topic the equivalent of a single direct object in English, there are also
cases of directional-focus verbs that do so. Thus the two sentences

Binili ng mangingisda ang bangka.
‘The fisherman bought the boat.’

Sinalpok ng alon ang bangka.
‘The wave struck the boat.’

both have as topics ang bangka ‘the boat’, which is the equivalent of the direct object in their English
counterparts. But while binili in the first sentence is an object-focus verb, sinalpok in the second is
directional-focus.

This distinction is not the arbitrary one it might appear to be. The distinction is based upon the kinds
of complements (cf. §2.11) that occur in the actor-focus counterparts of the sentences. These actor-focus
counterparts are:

Bumili ng bangka ang mangingisda.
‘The fisherman bought a boat.’

Sumalpok sa bangka ang alon.
‘The wave struck the boat.’

BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 7

The complements in these two sentences are ng bangka and sa bangka respectively. It is this difference in
the corresponding actor-focus sentences that underlies the distinction made between object-focus and
directional-focus verbs. As a generat rule, a goal-focus verb is considered object-focus if the topic that it
selects corresponds to a complement formed with ng (nax/), in the actor-focus if the topic that it
considered directional-focus if it corresponds to a complement formed with sa (/sa/) in the actor-focus
counterpart. (For exceptions to this general rule, cf. § §2.11 and 5.25.)

While the object-focus/directional-focus distinction is not exclusively a semantic one, there are certain
kinds of meanings that are typically associated with verbs that have one or the other of the focuses. One
kind of semantic correlation has already been observed in the case of those verbs that correspond to certain
English verbs that take both direct and indirect objects. (The Tagalog verbs in such cases are called
DOUBLE-OBSECT VERBS.) In the case of goal-focus verbs that have only a single object in the English
equivalents (SINGLE - OBJECT VERBS), the verbs that prove to be directional-focus are frequently those
whose meanings involve some element of movement toward (or, in some cases, away from) the goal. Thus,
in the above examples, sinalpok ‘struck’ involves an element of motion toward the topic, ang bangka ‘the
boat’, that is absent in the case of binili ‘bought’.

Many single-object directional-focus verbs, furthermore, are translated by English sentences without
direct objects, with the topic of the Tagalog sentence corresponding to a prepositional object in the English
equivalent: e.g.,

Binalikan niya ang Maynila.
‘He returned to Manila.”

Tinakasan niya ang bilangguan.
‘He escaped from the prison.”

Once more, directional-focus verbs of this kind usually have meanings that involve some element of motion.

Transitive verbs in basic sentences, then, have one of three focuses: actor-focus, object-focus,
directional-focus. This variability of focus — a variability that is much more extreme if non-basic sentences
are considered as well —is perhaps the most striking feature of Tagalog narrational sentences with
transitive-verb predicates. A Tagalog sentence, a basic sentence at least, can have only one topic, the focus
of attention of the sentence. In order to allow for elements in different semantic relations to the action
expressed by the verb to receive this focus, the language provides all bases of transitive verbs with a set of
alternative affixes, each member of which selects as topic an element in a different semantic relation to the
action. A base that occurs with a given set of alternative affixes belongs to the affix-correspondence class
defined by this set of affixes. An introduction to affix-correspondence classes is given in §2.12. First,
however, the complement classes and complements of the transitive verb must be considered.

§2.10. Complement classes.
The second component of a verbal predicate that includes a transitive verb is the complement(s):

Verbal

Transitive Verb Complement(s)

A complement expresses a person, thing, idea, etc., that is in a non-focus relation to the action expressed by
the verb. (An element in a focus relation to the action is always expressed in the topic.)

As was stated in §2.9, major transitive verbs may be actor-focus, object-focus, or directional-focus.
The type of complement(s) that a verb accepts varies with the focus of the verb. It also varies with the
verb’s COMPLEMENT CLASS.

Transitive verbs fall into one of three complement classes, according to the type of complement(s)
they accept in actor-focus constructions. These classes may be called: OBJECT VERBS, DIRECTIONAL
VERBS, and DOUBLE-OBJECT VERBS. (For certain purposes, the first two classes are sometimes

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
grouped together into a class of SINGLE-OBJECT VERBS.) Actor-focus object verbs accept an OBJECT
COMPLEMENT (but not a DIRECTIONAL COMPLEMENT); actor-focus directional verbs accept a
directional complement (but not an object complement); and actor-focus double-object verbs accept both
an object complement and a directional complement.

Every transitive actor-focus verb has at least one goal-focus (object-focus and/or directional-focus)
counterpast: i.e., a verb that expresses the same meaning as the actor-focus verb, but which requires that
the goal of the action, rather than the performer, be expressed in topic position. Every actor-focus object
verb has an object-focus counterpart; every actor-focus directional verb has a directional-focus counterpart;
and every actor-focus double-object verb has both an object-focus and a directional-focus counterpart.

When a goal (either object or direction) is in focus, an actor is expressed by an ACTOR
COMPLEMENT. In the case of single-object goal-focus verbs, this actor complement is the only
complement. Double-object goal-focus verbs accept a second complement as well: a directional
complement in the case of an object-focus verb, an object complement in the case of a goal-focus verb.

The relationships just outlined among complement class, focus of the verb, and complement type(s)
are summarized in the following diagram. (For sentences illustrating the structures represented in these
diagrams, cf. §2.12.)

Some complements are obligatory (i.e., they must always occur), others optional. In the case of most
goal-focus verbs, the actor complement may be omitted, if the sentence expresses an action performed by
unknown persons, or if the performer of the action is irrelevant. (When no actor complement is present, the
sentence is often equivalent to an English passive without a by phrase.) Thus:

Kinain ang pagkain.
‘The food was eaten.’

as well as:

Kinain ni Juan ang pagkain.
‘Juan ate the food.’

(In the second sentence, ni Juan is an actor complement.) Similarly, many actor-focus verbs have optional
object and/or directional complements. Thus:

Sumusulat ang istudyante.
‘The student is writing.’

as well as:

Sumusulat ng liham sa titser ang istudyante.
‘The student is writing a letter to the teacher.”

(In the second sentence, ng liham is an object complement, sa titser a directional complement.)

§2.11. Verbal complements in basic sentences.

The three kinds of verbal complements introduced in §2.10 are discussed below in the following
order: (1) the actor complement; (2) the object complement; (3) the directional complement. The
discussion covers only those forms of the complements that occur in basic sentences. (Those forms of the
complements that do not occur in basic sentences — viz., the sa-pronoun actor complement and the
Sa-phrase object complement — are presented in §5.25.)

(1). The actor complement. An actor complement may occur with any object-focus or
directional-focus verb, whether the verb is single-object or double-object. In basic sentences, the actor
complement is expressed by a ng PHRASE. The term ng phrase designates the following structures: the
marker ng ({nak/) plus an unmarked noun; the marker mi plus a personal noun; the ng form of a personal or
deictic pronoun. (A ng form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same contexts‘as structures that
include ng.) The ng forms of the personal pronouns are:

ko v namin ‘Land others/we"

nita ‘you and I/we’ natin ‘you and I (and others)/we’

mo ‘you’ ninyo ‘you (and others)’

niya ‘he/she’ nila ‘he and others/she and others/they’

The ng forms of the deictic pronouns are:

nire ‘this’ niyan ‘that’
nito ‘this’ niyon/noon ‘tha’

Some examples of basic sentences with actor complements are:

ng modista

ni Maria
Ginawa ang baro.
ko

nito

‘The dressmaker

“Maria

made the dress.’
‘I

‘This one

ng bus
ni Pedro
Pinuntahan ang Baguio.

niyan

‘The bus
‘Pedro

‘You
‘That one

ng bata

ni Mr. Cruz
Iniabot sa Nanay ang asin.
niya
noon

‘The child

‘Mr. Cruz

passed Mother the salt.’
‘He

‘That one
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 15

An actor complement that consists of ng plus an unmarked noun is sometimes translated in English
by a definite noun phrase (i.e., a phrase introduced by ‘the’), sometimes by an indefinite noun phrase (i.c.,
a phrase introduced by ‘a/an’ or ‘some’). This:

Ginising ng ingay ang bata.

may mean cither ‘A noise awakened the child’ or ‘The noise awakened the child’. (In most cases, however, a
ng-plus-unmarked-noun actor complement in itself suggests a meaning of definiteness, and indefiniteness is

indicated unambiguously only by the insertion of isa ‘one/a’ plus the linker naf-ng (cf. §3.11) before the
noun. Thus:

Ginawa ng modista ang baro.
‘The dressmaker made the dress.’

but:

Ginawa ng isang modista ang baro.
‘A dressmaker made the dress.’)

Marked-noun actor complements are necessarily definite, because of the definite meanings of marked
nouns themselves,

(2). The object complement. An object complement may occur with an actor-focus object verb or
double-object verb or with a directional-focus double-object verb. In basic sentences, the object
complement is expressed by ang phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ag form of
a deictic pronoun. (Personal pronouns and personal nouns do not occur as object complements in basic
sentences. Their occurrence as object complements in certain derived sentences is discussed in §5.25.)

Some examples of basic sentences with object complements are:

ng estudyante
Pumili ang titser.
noon

a student.’
‘The teacher chose
some of that.”

ng pagkain

Nagdala sa handaan ang Nanay.
nito
some food

‘Mother brought to the party.”

some of this

Inabutan ko ang bisita.

niyan

some meat

‘I passed to the guest.’

16 CHAPTER 2

An object complement that consist of ag plus an unmarked noun is normally indefinite in meaning,
and is translated by an English noun phrase that includes an indefinite article. The ng form of a deictic
pronoun also has, as object complement, an indefinite meaning: e.g., ‘some of this/that’.

(3). The directional complement. A directional complement may occur with an actor-focus
directional verb or double-object verb, or with an object-focus double-object verb. The directional
complement is expressed by a Sa PHRASE. The term sa phrase designates the following structures: the
marker sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form of a personal pronoun; the marker kay plus a personal
noun; the sa form of a deictic pronoun. (A sa form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same
contexts as structures that include sa.) The sa forms of the personal pronouns are:

akin ‘me’ amin ‘me and others/us*

kanita ‘you and me/us’ atin ‘you and me (and others)/us’

iyo ‘you’ inyo ‘you (and others)’

kaniya ‘him/her’ kanila ‘him and others/her and others/them’

The sa forms of the deictic pronouns are:

dine ‘this/here’ divan ‘that/there*
dito ‘this/here’ doon ‘that/there’

Some examples of basic sentences with directional complements are:

sa gusali
kay Fely
Bumalik ang bata.
sa kanila

BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 77

A directional complement that consists of sa plus an unmarked noun may in most cases be translated
with either a definite or indefinite noun phrase in English. (To express a meaning of indefiniteness
unambiguously within a sa complement, isa ‘one/a’ plus the linker ma/-ng (cf. §3.11) is inserted before the
noun. Thus:

Bumalik sa isang gulsali ang bata.
‘The child returned to a building.”

To express a meaning of definiteness unambiguously within a sa complement, the noun within the sa
complement is modified in some way (cf. §3.11, ff.). Thus:

Bumalik sa gusaling iyon ang bata.
‘The child retuned to that building.’)

Since the topic usually corresponds to a definite noun phrase in English and a directional complement
frequently does so, it is not always easy for an English translation to reveal the difference between an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement and a directional-focus construction with an actor

complement. For example, the Tagalog equivalent of ‘The child returned to the building’ may be cither an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement:

Bumalik sa gusali ang bata.
or a directional-focus construction with an actor complement:
Binalikan ng bata ang gusali.

The two Tagalog sentences differ in focus, in the element that is the center of attention. While a difference
of this kind may be shown in English — e¢.g., by intonation (‘The child returned to the building’ versus ‘The
child retumed to the building’), there are many cases in which, in fact, it is not shown,

Like directional topics, directional complements are frequently translated by prepositional phrases in
English. The particular preposition used in English depends upon the verb in the Tagalog sentence. The sa
phrase may be translated by an English phrase with ‘to’, ‘from’, ‘on’, ‘into’, etc: e.g.,

Pumunta sa palengke ang bata.
‘The child went to the market.’

Tumakas sa bilangguan ang bilanggo.
‘The prisoner escaped from the prison.’

Umupo sa silya ang ale.
‘The lady sat on the chair.’

Naghagis ng bato sa tubig ang bata.
‘The child threw a stone into the water.’

§2.12. Affix-correspondence classes.

An affix-correspondence class is a class to which a verb base is assigned by virtue of its co-occurrence
with a set of two or more major affixes (called an AFFIX SET) in major transitive verbs of differing focus
but otherwise identical meaning. A fuller statement of affix-correspondence classes is to be found in § §5.3
through 5.5. The present section presents only a few of the classes, by way of illustration.

Every affix set includes an actor-focus affix (i.e., an affix which, together with a base and an aspect,
forms an actor-focus verb). In addition to the actor-focus affix, the affix set may include an object-focus
affix, a directional-focus affix, or both.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
78 CHAPTER 2

The affix-correspondence classes to be illustrated below involve the following five affixes: -an, i-, -in,
mag-, and -um-. Two of these affixes, mag- and -wm-, form actor-focus verbs; one, é-, forms object-focus
verbs; and two, -in and -an, form either object-focus or directional-focus verbs. (The affix i also occurs as a
derived affix — cf. §5.17.)

In the illustrations, the single-object verbs are identified by two affixes, the first of which is an
actor-focus affix, the second an object-focus or directional-focus affix, according to whether the class is an
object-verb class or directional-verb class. Thus a base in the mag-/i- object-verb class forms an actor-focus
verb with mag-, an object-focus verb with i-; a base in the -wm-/-an directional-verb class forms an
actor-focus verb with -wmn-, a directional-focus verb with -ai. Double-object verbs are identified by three
affixes: actor-focus, object-focus, and directional-focus, in that order. Thus a base in the mag-/i-/-an class
forms an actor-focus verb with mag-, and object-focus verb with é, and a directional-focus verb with -ar.
Three classes each of object verbs, directional verbs, and double-object verbs are illustrated. The
abbreviations AF, OF, and DF precede sentences involving actor-focus, object-focus, and directional-focus
verbs respectively.

The three classes of object verbs chosen for purposes of illustration are: the mag-/-an class, the
mag-fi- class, and the -um-/-in class. Examples are:

1. mag-/-an

3. -um-/-in

§2.13. The topic.

As was stated in §2.2, the topic is the second major component of a basic sentence. The topic of a
basic sentence is expressed by an ang PHRASE. Ang phrase is a cover term for the following structures: ang
plus an unmarked noun; si plus a personal name; the ang form of a personal or deictic pronoun. (An ang
form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same contexts as structures that include ang.) The ang
forms of personal and deictic pronouns, which also occur as nominal predicates, have been presented in
§2.4. There is only one case in which the predicate and topic ang forms differ from one another. This is the
case of ‘you (singular)’, which is expressed by ‘kaw in predicate position, by ka in topic position (e.g.,

Matalino ka ‘You're intelligent’ versus {kaw and matalino ‘The intelligent one is you’).

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
80 CHAPTER 2

To summarize:

Topic Topic Topic Topic
ang Unmarked Noun _ si Personal Name Personal Pronoun Deictic Pronoun
(ang form) (ang form)

In basic sentences the topic commonly follows the entire predicate. If, however, the topic is the ang
form of a personal pronoun and the predicate is a phrase (e.g., an adjectival phrase or a
transitive-verb-plus-complement phrase), the pronoun usually must follow the first word of the predicate,
rather than the entire predicate. (More precisely, the pronoun follows the first word other than a
NON-PRE-ENCLITIC. For a detailed discussion of the sentence positions occupied by personal pronouns,
ef. §3.29.) Thus the topic ako ‘I’ in the following sentence appears immediately after the predicate verb
and precedes the complement of the verb:

Bumili ako ng bigas.
‘I bought some rice.”

Compare this sentence to:

ang babae.
Bumili ng bigas si Rosa.
iyon.
‘The woman
‘Rosa bought some rice.’
‘That one

In these sentences the topics (ang babae, si Rosa, iyon) occur in a common basic-sentence position: after
the entire predicate. But there is no parallel construction with a personal pronoun topic: *Bumili ng bigas
ako does not occur.

In cases where the predicate includes a goal-focus verb and the ng form of a pronoun as actor
complement, an ang-pronoun topic normally follows the ng pronoun rather than the verb, but still precedes
any other complement. Thus:

Binigyan mo ako ng salapi.
‘You gave me some money.’

This order — verb + ng pronoun + ang pronoun — is obligatory if the ng pronoun is monosyllabic (ko or
mo) and the ang pronoun is disyllabic (i.e., any ang pronoun except ka). There is no:

*Binigyan ako mo ng salapi.

If the ng pronoun and the ang pronoun are both disyllabic, the order ng pronoun + ang pronoun is merely
preferred, and the reverse order also occurs. Thus:

nila ako

Binigyan ng salapi.
ako nila

‘They gave me some money.’

 
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 81

If, on the other hand, the ng pronoun is disyllabic and the ang pronoun is the monosyllabic ka, ka
precedes the 1g pronoun. Thus:

Binigyan ka nila ng salapi.
‘They gave you some moncy.”

Finally, if both the ng pronoun and the ang pronoun are monosyllabic — ko and ka are the only potential
combination that fits the description — a special composite pronoun kita, which has the meaning ‘I
(actor}-you (goal)’, is used: e.g.,

Binigyan kita ng salapi,
‘L gave you some money.”

In all cases, the topic pronoun obligatorily precedes any complement other than amg pronoun. There is, for
example, no:

*Binigyan nila ng salapi ako.

(Topics other than personal pronouns may actually, in most cases, either precede or follow a verb

complement that is not ang form of a personal pronoun. Thus, in addition to the sentences listed earlier,
there are sentences like

ang babae
Bumili si Rosa ng bigas.
iyon
‘The woman
‘Rosa bought some rice.”
‘That one

in which the topic precedes the complement, and in which the meaning is not affected by the change of
word order. The order of components in basic sentences is further discussed in §2.15.)

Certain types of predicates cither optionally or obligatorily occur in constructions without topics.
These constructions are equivalent to certain English constructions that begin with ‘it is/was’ or ‘there
is/was’: e.g.,

Umuulan. ‘It’s raining.”
May libro sa mesa. ‘There’s a book on the table.’

They ase dealt with in the appropriate sections of subsequent chapters. (A distinction should be made
between genuinely topicless constructions like those just exemplified, and constructions with deleted topics
like the second sentence in:

Ano iyon? Bola (iyon).
‘What's that? (That’s) a ball.’

In genuinely topicless constructions, either there is no possibility of a topic or the addition of a topic
radically changes the meaning: c.g.,

May salapi sa bangko.
‘There’s money in the bank.”

but:

May salapi sa bangko si Juan.
‘Juan has money in the bank.’

82 CHAPTER 2

§2.14. Adverbials.

A basic sentence may include, in addition to the predicate and the topic, one or more ADVERBIALS.
Unlike the predicate and the topic themselves, adverbials are optional components of basic sentences. That
is, no basic sentence is incomplete for want of an adverbial, nor is the deletion of an adverbial implied by its
absence.

Adverbials that occur in basic sentences are divisible into two main classes: ENCLITIC PARTICLES
and MOVABLE ADVERBS. The enclitic particles are a small but important class of words that occur in
certain fixed word-order relations to other sentence elements. In general, enclitic particles occur after the
first word of a sentence (or, in non-basic sentences, the first word of a clause), whether this word
constitutes the entire predicate, a part of the predicate, or some other sentence element. In the following
three sentences, for example, the enclitic particle daw/raw ‘they say’ occurs respectively, after a nominal
predicate, the verb of a verbal predicate, and the negative word hindi (cf. §7.13):

Doktor daw ang bisita. ‘They say the guest is a doctor.’
Pumupunta raw sa Maynila ang bus. ‘They say the bus goes to Manila.’
Hindi raw doktor ang bisita. ‘They say the guest isn‘t a doctor.’

Tagalog has some eighteen enclitic particles, including several (e.g., the interrogative particle ba — cf.
§6.4) that do not occur in sentences here classified as basic sentences. Some of these enclitic particles (e.g.,
na ‘already/{now’ and pa ‘still/yet’) are mutually exclusive: that is, they do not occur in the same clause.
Others have a fixed or preferred word-order relation to one another. And all have a fixed word-order
relation to ng forms of personal pronouns serving as actor complements and to non-initial ang forms of
personal pronouns. (A detailed treatment of the enclitic particles is to be found in § §6.2 through 6.6.)

The second major type of adverbial that occurs optionally in basic sentences, the movable adverb,
may be a word -- e.g., ngayon ‘today’ — or a phrase - e.g., Aung Lanes ‘on Mondays’. Movable adverbs
differ from enclitic particles in that they do not, in general, have a fixed word-order relation to other
sentence elements. Kung Lunes, for example, may be added at any of the three different points to the
sentence

Pumapasok sa eskuwela si Juan.
‘Juan goes to school.”

without difference of meaning. Thus:

Pumapasok kung Lunes sa eskuwela si Juan.
Pumapasok sa eskuwela kung Lunes si Juan.
Pumapasok sa eskuwela si Juan kung Lunes.
‘Juan goes to school on Mondays.”

(Kung Lunes may also appear at the beginning of the sentence, but in this position it has emphatic or
contrastive meaning — cf. §7.2.) All of the above sentences may be considered basic sentences. For the sake
of simplicity, however, the order represented in the third sentence may conveniently be given priority over

the others, so that the structure of a basic sentence that includes a movable adverb may be diagrammed as
follows:

Basic Sentence

Predicate Topic Movable Adverb

(See §2.15 for a further treatment of the order of movable adverbs in basic sentences, and § §6.7 through
6.11 for a presentation of the various classes of movable adverbs.)

In addition to enclitic particles and movable adverbs there are several minor adverbial classes. Details
are presented in Chapter 6.

 
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE 83

$2.15. Order of components in basic sentences.

In English, the components of basic sentences occur in a more or less fixed order. Thus, in a sentence
like ‘The man gave the woman a book’, no change of order is possible without producing an ungrammatical
sentence or a sentence with a different meaning. The order of components in Tagalog basic sentences is
considerably less fixed. In many cases, the components of a basic sentence may occur in two or more
different orders without loss of grammaticalness or change of meaning. Thus, the following six sentences
include exactly the same components, are equally grammatical, and are identical in meaning:

Nagbigay ng libro sa babae ang lalaki.
Nagbigay ng libro ang lalaki sa babae.
Nagbigay sa babae ng libro ang lalaki.
Nagbigay sa babae ang lalaki ng libro.
Nagbigay ang lalaki ng libro sa babae.
Nagbigay ang lalaki sa babae ng libro.
‘The man gave the woman a book.’

(There are also other possible arrangements of the components of the above sentences: ¢.g.,

Sa babae nagbigay ng libro ang lalaki.
‘It was the woman that the man gave a book to.”

As the translation shows, however, this sentence is not identical in meaning with those given above.
Rearrangements of sentence components that are associated with some change of meaning are discussed in
§7.2.)

In the preceding sections of this chapter, only certain of the possible arrangements of the components
of Tagalog basic sentences are presented. (The arrangements presented in these sections are chosen to
facilitate the explanation of the structural relations of the components to one another, but are not
necessarily more common than certain other arrangements.) The previously presented
component-arrangements may be summarized as follows:

Nominal

Adjectival

Intransitive Verb + Topic ( + Movable Adverb)
Transitive Verb + Complement(s)

The other possible component-arrangements that occur in basic sentences may be explained as follows:

(1) A movable adverb may, in general, immediately precede a topic and/or any complement.
(2) A topic may, in general, immediately precede any complement.
(3) Two complements (of a double-object verb — cf. §2.10) may, in general, occur in either order.

(Exceptions to the above generalizations are found in the behavior of enclitic personal pronouns — cf.
§3.29. Hereafter, the word adverb is used in place of movable adverb.) Thus the component—classes
separated by slashes in the following formulas may, in general, occur in any order:

(a) Nominal
Adjectival + Topic/Adverb
Intransitive Verb
(b) Transitive Verb + Complement/Topic

(The formula provides for twenty-three arrangements other than the one illustrated.)

While the order of components (other than sentence-initial components) is, in general, not fixed in
basic sentences, not all the possible arrangements of components are equally common. Other things being
equal, the arrangements of components presented in the preceding sections (and represented, in the above
sets of examples, by the first member of each set) are, in many cases, the most common. However, the
length of a given component in relation to other components (i.¢., the number of words and/or syllables

each contains) may influence the order in which the components occur. There is a general tendency for
shorter components to precede longer components. One instance of this tendency is illustrated in the
following sentences:

Nagluto ng pagkain ang babac.
‘The woman cooked some food.”

Nagluto iyon ng pagkain.
‘That one cooked some food.”

Each sentence represents the more common of two possible orderings. (The alternative orderings are,
respectively, Nagluto ang babae ng pagkain, and Nagluto ng pagkain iyon.) \n the first sentence the object
complement (ng pagkain) and the topic (ang babae) are of equal length, and the complement precedes the

 
BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE . 85

topic. In the second sentence, the topic (vor) is shorter than the complement and precedes it. Similarly, a
one-word adverb — ¢.g., bukas ‘tomorrow’ — is more likely to precede a topic than is a multi-word
adverb — ¢.g., nang alas dos y medya ‘at two-thirty’. Thus the first of the following sentences represents a

more common sentence-type than does the second:

Darating bukas si Maria.
‘Maria is coming tomorrow,’

Darating nang alas dos y medya si Maria.
“Maria is coming at two-thirty.”

(This tendency of short components to precede Jong components is particularly apparent in derived
sentences, in which the length differences between components may be more striking. Thus the placement
of the adverb (BUKAS) before the expanded topic (ang isang babaeng, etc.) in the following sentence
represents a very much more likely ordering of components than would the reverse:

Darating bukas ang isang babaeng nakilala ko sa probinsya.
‘A woman I met in the provinces is coming tomorrow.’)

Nominals and Their Expansions

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 87

§3.1. Introduction.

The preceding chapter introduced four major classes of sentence components: NOMINALS,
ADJECTIVALS, VERBALS, and ADVERBIALS. The present chapter and the three that follow it examine
these classes in detail. In cach case, information is given not only about the members of the class that occur

in basic sentences, but also about certain EXPANSIONS of the class and certain other DERIVED CON-
STRUCTIONS relevant primarily to the class.

An EXPANSION is a structure that does not itself occur in basic sentences, but that occurs in some
or all of the same contexts as a particular class of basic-sentence components. An expansion of a
component class may consist of a member of the class plus some other structural element(s), or it may
consist of a structure that entirely replaces a member of the class. For example, an English noun phrase like
‘a question’, which occurs in a basic sentence like ‘The man asked the woman a question’, may be replaced
by such constructions as ‘a difficult question’ and ‘what to do’: ‘The man asked the woman a difficult
question’, ‘the man asked the woman what to do’. Both constructions may be considered expansions of the
noun phrase. In one case, ‘a difficult question’, the noun phrase itself appears in the expansion; in the
other, ‘what to do’, it does not.

A DERIVED CONSTRUCTION is any construction that does not itself occur in a basic sentence, but
that is related to a construction that does so occur. An expansion, therefore, is one type of derived
construction, There are, however, other types. For example, ‘The woman was asked a question by the man’
may be considered to be derived from ‘The man asked the woman a question’, yet does not include any
expansions.

Derived constructions of the type just exemplified, which show, rather than an expansion, a
rearrangement of sentence components and/or the addition and/or the deletion of components, are
discussed in one of two places in the present text. If the derived construction is best understood in relation
to a particular class of basic-sentence components, it is discussed in connection with that class in Chapters
3, 4, 5, or 6. If, on the other hand, the derived construction is not relevant primarily to a particular class of
basic-sentence components, it is discussed in Chapter 7, DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE
STRUCTURES. Thus, for example, the various derived verb focuses (benefactive :ocus, causative focus,
etc.) are dealt with in Chapter 5, VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS, since they are best understood in
relation to the class of verbal structures, while negation, a general phenomenon that is pertinent to a
number of different component-classes and structure types, is dealt with in Chapter 7.

The present chapter is arranged as follows. §§3.2 through 3.8 deal with the various classes of
nominal words that occur in Tagalog: marked nouns (3.2), personal pronouns (3.3), deictic pronouns (3.4),
personal nouns (3.5), unmarked nouns (3.6), derived noun formations (3.7), and nominal compounds (3.8).
§3.9 is concerned with the pluralization of nominals, §3.10 with coordinate nominal constructions.
Modification constructions other than possessive modification constructions are presented in § §3.11
through 3.19; possessive modification constructions are presented in §3.20. Reflexive and intensive
nominal constructions are presented in §3.21, limiters and limited nominal constructions in §3.22, and ng
phrases of specification in §3.23. The next five sections are concerned with various types of
nominalizations: nominalized adjectivals and verbals (3.24), nominalized basic forms (3.25), gerunds (3.26),
nominalized verb bases (3.27), and nominal clauses (3.28). §3.29 deals with enclitic personal pronouns.

§3.2. Marked nouns.

As was stated in §2.4,a MARKED NOUN is so called because its sentence function is always marked,
either by its own form or by the form of a preceding marker. Every marked noun occurs in three different
forms or with three different markers, each form or marker indicating a particular set of sentence functions.
The three forms (of the marked noun itself or of the preceding marker) are called: the ag form, the ng
form, and the sa form. Ang forms (or nouns preceded by ang-form markers) occur as predicates or topics:
ng forms (or nouns preceded by ng-form markers) occur as verb complements or possessive modifiers (see
§3.19), and in general, in all other contexts in which ng-plus-unmarked-noun phrases may occur: sa forms
(or nouns preceded by sa-form markers) occur as verb complements, as possessive predicates or modifiers

(cf. §§4.22 and 3.19), and, in general, in all other contexts in which sa-plus-unmarked-noun phrases may
occur.

88 CHAPTER 3

Tagalog has three classes of marked nouns: personal pronouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns.
They are presented below in that order.

§3.3. Personal pronouns.

The forms of the personal pronouns are given in Chart 7. On the chart, the pronouns are arranged in
two groups: NON-PLURAL and PLURAL. (The first group is called non-plural rather than singular because
it included dual pronouns, meaning literally ‘you (singular) and I’. The plural pronouns have, as a group, the
meanings of the corresponding non-plural pronouns with the additional meaning ‘and others’ (or ‘and
another’): thus the first-person plural is literally ‘I and others’, the dual plural ‘you (singular) and I and
others’, etc. For each pronoun, both the conventional spellings and a phonemic transcription are given. For
the sake of simplicity, only subject pronouns (c.g., ‘I') are shown in the English translations, although in
many cases an ang form may actually correspond to an English object pronoun (e.g., ‘me*), ang form toa
possessive pronoun (e.g., ‘my’, ‘mine’), and asa form to either an object pronoun or a possessive pronoun.
The translations on the chart are, in any case, only approximate. (See below for details about the use and
English equivalents of the Tagalog pronouns.)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 89

As the chart shows, Tagalog distinguishes eight different categories of personal pronouns: a
non-plural and a plural of the first person, the dual, the second person, and the third person. One of these
categories, the second-person non-plural, is represented by four distinct forms: two ang forms (ikaw and
ka, predicate and topic forms respectively — cf. §2.13), a ng form, and a sa form. The other seven
categories are represented by three forms each.

The first-person singular — ako/ko/akin — is the only category of Tagalog personal pronouns that
corresponds with perfect consistency to a category of English pronouns (the first-person
singular: ‘I/me/my/mine’). In other cases, a single Tagalog category corresponds to several English
categories and/or several Tagalog categories to a single English category.

The Tagalog dual non-plural — kata/nita/kanita — corresponds to the English first-person plural
(‘we/usfour/ours’) when the latter is used to refer to the speaker and a single individual addressed. The dual
non-plural is thus, literally, ‘you (singular) and I’, Dual non-plural pronouns are obsolescent in educated
Manila Tagalog, and many speakers do not use them at all, using the dual plural — sayo/natin/atin — for
‘you (singular) and I’ as well as ‘you (plural) and I’; sce below.

The Tagalog second-person singular — ikaw/ka/mo/iyo -- corresponds to the English second-person
(‘you/your/yours’) when the latter is used to address a single individual who is a relative belonging to a
younger gencration, a friend, a social inferior, or — in the case of children and adolescents — an age-mate;
the secund-person non-plural is also used in addressing God. In addressing single individuals who do not fit
into one of these categories, the second-person singular is replaced by the sccond-person or third-person
plural; see below. (As was noted in §2.13, there is a special composite pronoun kita /kitah/ that combines
the meanings of a first-person-singular mg form and a second-person-singular ang form. Kita thus occurs in
place of the non-occurring sequences *ko ka and *ka ko).

The Tagalog third-person singular — siya/niya/kaniya — corresponds to both the masculine
third-person singular (‘he/him/his’) and the feminine third-person singular (‘she/her/hers’) in cases where
these English pronouns refer to human beings, or to pet animals. The Tagalog third-person singular also
corresponds to the English neuter third-person singular (‘it/its’) in the few cases in which the latter is used
to refer to a baby or a pet animal. The range of English counterparts for siya/niya/kaniya is illustrated
below:

ang lalaki
ang babac.
Wala rito Nasa bukid siya.
ang sanggol.
ang aso ko.
‘The man He’s
‘The woman She's
isn't here. at the farm.’
jae baby He’s/She’s/It’s
‘My dog

Tagalog has no inanimate third-person pronoun, and none which refers to animate creatures other
than human beings and pets. Therefore, in cases in which English ‘he’ and ‘she’ do not refer to a human
being or a pet, or in which ‘it’ does not refer to a baby or a pet, Tagalog has no overt equivalent of the
English pronoun: e.g.,

ang baka

ang toro
Wala rito Nasa bukid.

ang kotse

ang libro
‘The cow It’s/She’s
‘The bull It’s/He’s

isn’t here. at the farm.”

‘The car It's/She’s

‘The book It’s

 
90 CHAPTER 3

Both the first-person plural — kami/naminfamin— and the dual plural — tayo/natin/atin — are
normally translated by the English first-person plural (‘we/us/our/ours’). The difference in meaning
between the two Tagalog categories is a matter of the composition of the groupings they designate. The
category that is here called the first-person plural may also be called the EXCLUSIVE first-person plural,
because it specifically excludes the person(s) addressed. The category that is here called the dual plural may
also be called the INCLUSIVE first-person plural, because it specifically includes the person(s) addressed.
The translation of an English sentence like ‘We saw you’ necessarily involves the first-person plural
(exclusive) as the equivalent of ‘we’, since it is clear that the person addressed is not part of the designated
grouping. The translation of an English sentence like ‘we saw him’, however may involve either the dual
plural (inclusive) or the first-person-plural (exclusive), according to whether the speaker intends to include
or exclude the person(s) addressed from the ‘we’ grouping. Thus:

Nakita namin kayo.
‘We saw you.”

namin
Nakita natin siya.
‘We saw him.”

As was noted above, the dual non-plural — Kata/nita/kanita — is obsolescent in contemporary Manila
Tagalog, and the dual plural is normally used for a grouping that includes only the speaker and a single
individual addressed as well as for a grouping that includes others in addition to these. It is possible that at
one time the dual plural was used as a polite substitute for the dual nun-plural in the same way that the
second-person plural is used as a polite substitute for the second-person non-plural (see below). In
contemporary Tagalog, in any case, the use of tayo/natin/atin to designate the speaker and a single
individual addressed does not suggest politeness or social distance, and people who address one another with
the second-person non-plural pronouns ikaw/ka/mojiyo use the dual plural, rather than the dual singular, to
designate the grouping ‘you (singular) and I’.

The second-person plural — kayo/ninyojfinyo — is used as the equivalent of the English second-person
(‘you/your/yours’) in addressing more than one individual, and also in addressing a single individual
between whom and the speaker there is some social distance. The use of the second-person plural in
addressing a single individual may be considered ‘polite’ or ‘respectful’. The second-person plural is used by
children in addressing adults, by employees in addressing employers, by adults who may be social equals
but not close friends in addressing one another, etc. It is also used in addressing relatives belonging to an
older generation, regardless of whether they are actually older in years; thus an uncle or aunt younger than
the speaker is normally addressed with the second-person plural pronoun. (The ng form of the
second-person plural pronoun is frequently contracted from ninyo to nyo /nyoh/ in conversation.

Like the third-person non-plural, the third-person plural — sile/nila/kanila — is strictly animate in
reference. It corresponds to the English third-person plural (‘they/them/their/theirs’) when the latter refers
to human beings or pet animals. Thus:

lalaki.
babae.
Wala rito ang mga Nasa bukid sila.
sanggol.
aso ko.

   
   
 

‘The men
‘The women
aren’t here. They’re at the farm.’

‘The babies
‘My dogs
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 2

When the English third-person plural has an inanimate reference or refers to animals that are not pets,
it has no overt equivalent in Tagalog. Thus:

baka.
Wala rito ang mga Nasa bukid.
kotse.
(™ mh
aren’t here. They’re at the farm.”
‘The cars

The third-person plural is occasionally used as a substitute for the second-person plural in addressing
one or more persons. Used in this way, the third-person plural indicates great respect and very marked
social distance. It was formerly used, for example, by subjects addressing monarchs, and might now be
used, especially in writing, by a humble citizen addressing an august politial personal.

The third-person plural is also occasionally used as a substitute for the third-person singular in
referring to a respected personage. Thus a child might use the third-person plural in referring to one of its
parents.

The following list summarizes the correspondences discussed above between Tagalog and English
pronouns. In the first column, the subject forms of the English pronouns are given, in the second the
ang-form Tagalog equivalents. Infrequent Tagalog equivalents are written in parentheses. The symbol ¢
indicates the absence of an overt equivalent:

English Tagalog

T ako

‘you’ ikaw/ka, kayo, (sila)
‘he? siya, (sila), (¢)
‘she’ siya, (sila), (¢)

‘iv 9, (siya)

‘we’ kami, tayo, (kata)
“they” sila, d

The ang forms and ng forms of the personal pronouns never occur with a marker. The sa forms, on
the other hand, are in most cases preceded by the marker sa. Sa regularly fails to occur before the sa form
of a pronoun only where the pronoun is used as a possessive modifier (cf. §3.20), and is optional when the
pronoun occurs in a possessive predicate (cf. §4.22) or after the comparative marker kaysa (cf. §4.15). In
all other cases, sa obligatorily precedes the sa form of a personal pronoun.

(In certain specifiable cases, the ang and ng forms of the personal pronouns obligatorily occur in
sentence positions that are either distinct from those occupied by nominals of other types, or not
obligatory in the case of nominals of other types. Details are presented in §3.29.)

§3.4. Deictic Pronouns.

Tagalog distinguishes four categories of deictic, or demonstrative, pronouns. The ang, ng, and sa
forms of these pronouns are shown in Chart 8. In the discussion that follows the chart, the ag forms are
used to signify the entire category, unless otherwise specified.

noon /nu’on/

92 CHAPTER 3

(The forms shown on the chart are the most common forms of the deictics. In addition to these forms, the
following literary variants occur: yari /yarih/, niyari /nyarih/, and yaon fya‘on{ — variants of, respectively,
ire, nire, and iyon. In informal! conversation, ivyon is sometimes pronounced /yu'on/.)

English distinguishes only two categories of deictic pronouns: ‘this’ and ‘that’. (The English deictics
have, however, distinctive plural forms, ‘these’ and ‘those’; for pluralization of the Tagalog deictics, cf.
$3.9.) Each of the English categories corresponds to two Tagalog categories: ‘this’ to both ére and ito,
‘that’ to both ivan and iyon.

Some Tagalog speakers use ire and ito interchangeably to refer to things close to the speaker
(approximately within arm's reach). Others make a distinction between the two, using ire for things in
actual contact with the speaker's body (e.g., something in the speaker's hand or something worm) and ito as
a more general category indicating proximity to the speaker. Still others — possibly a majority of educated
Manila speakers — use ire rarely or not at all.

A much more consistent distinction is made in the case of iyan and iyon. lyan is used to refer to
things close to the person(s) addressed (approximately within arm’s reach) and less close to the speaker,
while iyon is used to refer to things close to neither the speaker nor the person(s) addressed. (As Chart 8
shows, ivon has two ng forms, niyon and noon. These forms are free alternants. Thus:

niyon
Uminom ang bata.
noon

‘The child drank some of that.’)

Like English, Tagalog uses deictic pronouns to refer to abstractions, situations, actions, etc., as well as
to concrete objects. In these cases, the choice of deictic category is a matter of ‘psychological
proximity — whether the abstraction, etc., is felt to be closely identified with the speaker, with the hearer
but not the speaker, or with neither. If the abstraction, etc. is felt to be closely identified with the speaker,
ito (or ire) is used; if it is felt to be closely identified with the hearer but not the speaker, ‘yas is used; if, as
is perhaps most often the case, it is felt to be closely identified with neither the speaker nor the hearer, jyon
is used. Some examples are:

ire.
{ie ;

Mahirap na kalagayan
ian
fo
‘This
is a difficult situation.’
‘That
{ie}
ito.
Mabuting idea
iyan.
{Font
‘This
is a good idea.”
‘That

The Tagalog deictics may be used to refer to people, in which case (as in certain other cases) they
must often be translated ‘this one’ or ‘that one’ in English: ¢.g.,

Maglalaba ito; magpaplantsa iyon.
‘This one will wash; that one will iron.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 93

Sometimes a deictic, particularly iyon is used in contexts in which English would normally use a
personal pronoun: e.g.,

si Linda. Maganda
Nakita ko si Ben. Guwapo iyon.
ang pelikula. Interesante
Linda. She’s beautiful.’
‘I saw fu He's handsome.”
the movie. It’s interesting.”

Tagalog too may use a personal pronoun in such cases, provided that the referent is human. Thus:
Nakita ko si Linda. Maganda siya.

But the use of the deictic is at least equally common.

The sa forms of the deictics may often be translated by ‘here’ (for dine and dito) and ‘there’ (for
diyan, and doon), which are equivalent to ‘(to/in, etc.) this/that (place)’. This is usually the case when the
sa form occurs as a locative adverb (cf. §6.9) and frequently the case when the sa form occurs as a
directional complement (cf. §2.11). Thus:

dito.
Mabuti ang panahon

doon.

here.”
‘The weather is good

there.

tine
Inilagay ko ang maleta.

riyan

here’
‘I put the suitcase

there.”

(As was noted in §1.20, the initial /d/ of the sa forms of a deictic is frequently replaced by /r/ when the
deictic occurs in the middle of a phrase, particularly after a vowel.)

§3.5. Personal nouns.
The ang, ng, and sa forms of the personal-noun markers are, respectively, si, ni, and kay: e.g.,

Ipinakilala ni George kay Jose si Maria.
‘George introduced Maria to Jose.”

(Cf. §3.9 for the pluralized forms of the personal-noun markers.)
Personal nouns designate particular human beings (or pet animals). All nouns that serve as personal
nouns may also serve as unmarked nouns. These unmarked nouns represent names cited as names. Thus:

Rosa ang paborito kong pangalan.
‘My favorite name is Rosa.’

as Opposed to:

 

Eléments sous di d'auteur
se aaa a
94 CHAPTER 3

Si Rosa ang paborito kong kaklase.
‘My favorite classmate is Rosa.”

In predicate position, the personal-noun marker si may be replaced before a personal noun by its
non-personal counterpart, ang. When the replacement occurs, the resultant ang-plus-personal-noun

construction has the meaning ‘the one named 2 Cg,

Ang Rosa ang kapatid niya.
‘His sister is the one named Rosa.’

This replacement is found only in predicate position. There is, for example, no:

*(Ang) kapatid niya ang Rosa.

And no similar replacement of ni by ng or Kay by sa is possible. (There are however, certain plural
constructions — cf. §3.9 — and modification constructions — cf. §3.16 —in which personal nouns are
preceded by non-personal markers.)

There are two small groups of unmarked nouns that may optionally be used as personal nouns. The
first of these is a group of nouns that designate relatives older, or of an older generation, than the
speaker — e.g., ate ‘eldest sister’, Auya ‘eldest brother’, ina/nanay ‘mother’, ama/tatay ‘father’, tiya ‘aunt’,
tiyo ‘uncle’, lola ‘grandmother’, /olo ‘grandfather’. There is some similarity between the Tagalog practice of
using nouns that designate relatives as personal nouns and the English practice of using such nouns as
proper nouns: e.g., ‘Mother’, ‘Father’, etc. But while in English there is a consistent difference in meaning
between the common and the proper noun (e.g., ‘Mother’ is usually one’s own parent, ‘the mother’ never
is), in Tagalog the referent of the noun may be exactly the same when it is used as an unmarked noun as
when it is used as a personal noun. Thus ang nanay and si Nanay may both mean ‘Mother’, and refer to
one’s own parent. (Ang nanay may, however, also mean ‘the mother’, a meaning that si Nanay does not
have.)

The second group of unmarked nouns that may be used as personal nouns is a small group of nouns
designating occupations —e.g., abogado ‘lawyer’, alkalde ‘mayor’, kapitan ‘captain’, doktor ‘doctor’,
presidente ‘president’, propesur ‘professor’, sarhento ‘sergeant’. These unmarked nouns frequently occur as
titles followed by family names, in which case the title and the name function as a unitary personal
noun — e.g., si Abogado Cruz, ‘Lawyer Cruz’, si Kapitan Santos ‘Captain Santos’. The use of the title alone
as a personal noun, which derives from deletion of the name after the title, has no close parallels in spoken
English (although one may occasionally hear a nurse say, ‘Doctor will see you now’). Written English
however, uses a capitalized title (following ‘the’) in some of the same contexts as those in which Tagalog
personalizes the title. Some examples of the use as personal nouns of nouns that designate relatives and
professions are:

ni Tatay
Binigyan ng regalong para
ng tatay
‘Father gave Grandmother a present for Grandfather.’

kay Lolo si at

sa Lolo ang Lola.

ni Kapitan kay Alkalde si Propesor.
Ipinakilala
t kapitan sa alkalde ang propesor.
Captain fProfessor) ( Mayor.’
‘The introduced the to the
captain lprotessor) | mayor.”

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 95

In addition to titles that designate occupations, there are titles that designate sex and marital status,
which, as in English, normally precede family names. In contemporary Manila Tagalog, Joan words from
English — Mister, Misis, Miss —are frequently used. There are, however, native Tagalog
equivalents: Ginoong (ginoo plus the linker na-/-ng — cf. §3.11), ‘Mr.’. Ginang ‘Mrs.’, and Binibining
(binibini plus linker) ‘Miss’. Thus:

{Mister
Ginoong
Misis

Ito si Reyes.
Ginang

Miss \
Binibining

Mr.
‘Thisis  <Mrs. Reyes.’

Miss

There are also certain titles of respect used before the first names of older or prominent people: for men,
Don, Mang; for women, Donya, Aling. Thus: si Don or si Mang Luis, si Donya or si Aling Luisa.

There is one important exception to the rule that personal nouns are always preceded by a marker.
When a personal noun is used in direct address, it is unmarked. Thus:

Magandang umaga, Juan.
‘Good morning, Juan.

§3.6. Unmarked nouns.

An unmarked noun is a nominal of invariant form that may occur without a marker in predicate
position. The unmarked noun class is the largest nominal class of Tagalog. Most of the members of the class
correspond to common nouns in English: e.g., bata ‘child’, bukid ‘farm’, buti ‘goodness’. The class also
includes certain nouns that correspond to proper nouns in English: place names, names of events, etc:

Maynila ang bayan ko.
‘My home town is Manila.’

Pasko ang paborito kong pista.
*My favorite holiday is Christmas.”

(Generally, however, unmarked nouns that correspond to proper nouns in English are definitized in
predicate position. Thus, preferably: Ang Maynila ang bayan ko, Ang Pasko ang paborito kong pista. (Cf.
§7.17 fora discussion of the definitized predicate.)

As was noted in §2.4, an unmarked noun in predicate position usually expresses either an
INDEFINITE or a GENERIC meaning: respectively, ‘a member of the class__’ or ‘the class__’. An

unmarked-noun predicate expressing an indefinite meaning is usually translated by an indefinite article
(‘a/an’ or ‘some’) plus a noun in English:

Bahay
Mansanas ito.

Kape

a house.’
‘This is an apple.”

some coffee.

% CHAPTER 3

An unmarked-noun predicate expressing a generic meaning is often translated by a noun without an article
in English:

Mansanas
ang pangunahin nilang ani.
Kape
apple(s).’
‘Their major crop is
coffee.”

In topic position unmarked nouns are preceded by ang. An ang-plus-unmarked-noun topic normally
expresses either a DEFINITE meaning, ‘an identified member of the class —* (corresponding to ‘the’ plus
noun in English) or a generic meaning:

Matamis ang kendi.
“The candy

Unmarked nouns serving as actor complements after ng and directional complements after sa may
express either definite or indefinite meanings (cf. § §2.11 and 5.25):

Ibinigay ng maestra sa bata ang aklat.

tA a
teacher gave the book to child.’
‘The the

Unmarked nouns serving as object complements after ng normally express indefinite meanings:

Bumili ako ng sombrero.
‘Il bought a hat.’

The kinds of meanings expressed by unmarked nouns in other constructions — e.g., adjectival and adverbial
phrases, possessive modifiers — are dealt with in connection with the constructions themselves, in the
appropriate sections below.

The unmarked-noun class is divisible into a number of subclasses. One such subclass is a relatively
small group of GENDER-MARKED nouns borrowed from Spanish. The gender of these nouns is indicated
by the final vowel. Members of the gender-marked subclass with masculine referents all end in-o /oh/: ¢.g.,
biyudo |biyu:doh/ ‘widower’; maestro {ma‘e:stroh{ ‘teacher (masculine)’; members of the subclass with
feminine referents all end in -@ (fah/): e.g., biyuda /biyu:dah/ ‘widow’, maestra /ma’e:strah{ ‘teacher
(feminine)’. A good many gender-marked nouns represent occupations:

kosturero/-a ‘dressmaker’
kusinero/-a ‘cook’
mensahero/-a ‘messenger’
sekretaryo/-a ‘secretary’
tindero/-a ‘vendor’

Others represents nationalities, relationships, etc:

Amerikano/-a ‘American’
amigo/-a ‘friend’

ihoj-a ‘son/daughter’
Pilipino}-a ‘Filipino’
tiyo/-a ‘uncle/aunt’

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 97

Where two gender-marked nouns occur as, respectively, predicate and topic of a sentence, they must
agree in gender. Thus:

Biyudo ang maestro.
‘The teacher is a widower.’

Biyuda ang maestra.
‘The teacher is a widow.’

Similarly, when a gender-marked noun occurs as predicate or topic opposite a non-gender-marked noun
with a specifically masculine or feminine referent (¢.g., lalaki ‘man’, babae ‘woman’) the appropriate
gender-marked form must be used: e.g.,

Maestro ang lalaki.
‘The man is a teacher.’

Maestra ang babae.
‘The woman is a teacher.”

(There is, however, at least one exception. The noun Pilipino may be used to refer to a Filipino of either
sex; cf. §4.2 for the agreement of gender-marked nouns and gender-marked adjectives.)

Other subclasses of unmarked nouns are discussed in connection with the structures or sentence
elements to which they are pertinent: e.g., the COUNT and MASS noun subclasses, which are discussed in
connection with pluralization in §3.9 and in connection with interrogative quantifiers in §7.11; and the
subclass whose members may optionally be used as personal nouns, discussed in connection with personal
nouns in §3.5.

§3.7. Derived noun formations.

A DERIVED NOUN is a noun that includes at least one NOMINAL AFFIX and a NOMINAL BASE.
For practical purposes, a nominal affix may be defined as a meaningful element that characteristically
occurs as part of a noun and never occurs independently as a distinct word. Nominal affixes are either
PREFIXES or SUFFIXES, according to whether they precede or follow the nominal base. A nominal base
is a meaningful element within a derived noun that may also occur independently (c.g., as a noun or an
adjective) and/or as the base of a non-nominal word (e.g., as a verb base).

The inventory of classes of derived noun formations presented in this section is not intended to be
exhaustive. However, with the exception of the GERUNDS, or verbal nouns, which are reserved for
separate presentation in §3.26, the inventory includes most of the more productive classes, as well as
certain less productive ones.

In the inventory, each class is designated by a formula in which the symbol ‘B’ stands for ‘nominal
base.’ The symbol ‘dup, -’ in a formula stands for a prefix that normally consists of a duplication of the first
consonant and first vowel of the syllable before which it occurs, except that: (1) the vowel of dup,- is
always short, whether the vowel of the syllable it precedes is short or long; (2) the vowel of dup, - is /i/ if
the vowel of the following syllable is /e/, or if the following syllable begins with a consonant cluster whose
second member is /y/; (3) the vowel of dup,- is fu/ if the vowel of the following syllable is fof, or if the
following syllable begins with a consonant cluster whose second member is /w/. The symbol ‘dup.’ in a
formula stands for a prefix that normally consists of duplication of the entire base, except that: (1) the
last vowel of dup ,- is long if the independent form of the base ends in /h/ or /'/ (the /h/ or /"/ does not
itself occur in dupg-): otherwise it is short; (2) all other vowels of dupp- are short. Affixes other than
dup,- and dupg- are represented in the formulas by their conventional spelling, except that prefixes are
followed and suffixes preceded by a hyphen. In cases where there are two classes identical in composition
but unrelated in meaning, the classes are listed separately without comment.

For each class of formations listed, the class meaning(s), expressed as a function of the meanings of
the bases, and examples with translations, are presented. Each example is followed by a parenthetic citation

98 CHAPTER 3

either of the base alone or of a related formation in which the base occurs. The citation is of the base alone
unless otherwise noted.

Many of the listings include a discussion of pronunciation. In the absence of any comment to the
contrary, it is to be understood that there is no inherent length in the affix(es), and that the bases show no
phonemic change from theirs CITATION FORMS. (The citation form of a base is the form that it has in its
independent occurrence — or, in a few cases, in its occurrence in a related formation.) Such general
phenomena of Tagalog phonology as the interchange of /d/ and /r/, fe/ and /i/, or Jof and /u/ (cf. § §1.20.,
1.7, and 1.10) or the loss of /h/ and /'/ before a consonant (cf. §§ 1.14 and 1.17) are not commented upon.

(1) Bt-an
Meaning: a place associated with what the base designates.
Examples:
aklatan ‘library’ (aklat *book’)
giikan ‘threshing place’ (giik ‘thresh’)
gulayan ‘vegetable garden’ (gulay ‘vegetables’)
halamanan ‘garden’ (halaman ‘plant’)
hiraman ‘place for borrowing” (hiram ‘borrow’)
kumpisalan ‘confessional’ (kumpisal confess’)
lansonesan ‘place for growing lansones’ (lansones ‘a species of fruit’)
taguan ‘hiding place’ . (tago ‘hide’)
tarangkahan “gate” (tarangka ‘lock’)
Pronunciation:

(a) Bases with long penultimate vowels:
If the base has two syllables, vowel length is normally lost in the derived noun; if the base has three or
more syllables, vowel length is shifted to the first vowel of the base if this is syllable-final, is otherwise lost.

{gulayan/ (/gu:lay/)
/tagu’an/ ({ta‘go’/)
{ha‘lamanan/ (/hala‘man/)
/lansonesan/{ (/lanso-nes/)

(b) Bases with short penultimate vowels:

The final vowel of the base is normally lengthened in the derived noun. If the first vowel is
syllable-final, it is also normally lengthened; otherwise it is not. Other syllable-final vowels (in bases of three
or more syllables) may optionally be lengthened.

fhisra*man/ (/hiram/)
fakla:tan} (/’aklat/)
{kumpi(-)sa‘lan/ (/kumpisal/)
{ta*ranka*han/ (/tarankah/)

(Some derived nouns are irregular with respect to lengthening:

/giikan/ (/eiik/).)

Remarks: Certain derived nouns of this class are followed by ng phrases that correspond to the
ng-phrase object complements taken by actor-focus verbs formed with the same base: ¢.g.,

giikan ng palay (cf. maggiik ng palay
‘place for threshing rice’ “thresh rice’)

hiraman ng pera (cf. humiram ng pera
‘place for borrowing money’ “borrow money’)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS )

(2) Be-an

Meaning: reciprocal or joint performance of the action designated by the related verb (an -wm- or
mag- verb) formed with the same base.

Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

awayan ‘fighting (one another)’ (umaway ‘fight’)
bigayan ‘giving (one another)’ (magbigay ‘give’)
bulabugan ‘scaring away (one another)” (bumulabog ‘scare away’)
kalabugan ‘falling together with a (kumatabog ‘fall with

loud noise’ a loud noise’)
paliwanagan ‘explaining (to one another)’ (magpaliwanag ‘explain’)
parusahan ‘punishing (one another)’ (magparusa ‘punish’)
saksakan ‘stabbing (one another)’ (sumaksak ‘stab’)
sulatan ‘writing (one another)’ (sumulat ‘write’)
takbuhan ‘running (together) (tumakbo ‘run’)
Pronunciation:

(a) For two-syllable bases, the vowel length patterns are the same as for Class (1) B +-an formations (see
above). Thus:

f'awayan/{ (f’a:way/)
{bi:ga:yan/ (/bigay/)
/ka:ma:yan/ ({kamah/)
{saksa:kan{ ({saksak/)
{sulatan/ (/su:lat/)
/takbu:han/ (/takboh/)

(b) For bases of three or more syllables, the first vowel (if syllable-final) and the final vowel of the base are
normally long in the derived nouns, regardless of the original vowel-length pattern. Length is optional in
other syllable-final vowels.

/bu:la(:)bu:gan/ ({/bula:bog/)
fpa:li(: }wa(:)na:gan/ (/paliwa:nag/)
/pa:ru(:)sa:han/ (/paru:sah/)
{ka:la(:)bu:gan/ (/kalabog/)

Remarks: Certain derived nouns in this class may be followed by ng phrases that correspond to the
ng-phrase object complements taken by the related actor-focus verbs formed with the same base: ¢.g.,

bigayan ng regalo (cf. magbigay ng regalo
‘giving one another presents’ “give a present’)
sulatan ng liham (cf. sumulat ng liham
‘writing one another letters’ ‘write a letter’)

(3) Bt-in
Meaning: an object of the action designated by the related verb formed with the same base.
Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

alagain ‘something to take care of (mag-alaga ‘take care of?)
aralin ‘something to study” (mag-aral ‘study’)

awitin ‘song’ (umawit ‘sing’)

bilihin ‘something to buy” (bumili ‘buy’)

burdahin ‘something to embroider’ (magburda ‘embroider’)

100 CHAPTER 3
kumpunihin ‘something to repair’ (mag-kumpuni ‘repair’)
linisin ‘something to clean’ (maglinis *clean’)
lutuin *(the) cooking’ (magluto ‘cook’)
plantsahin
‘something to iron’ (magp(a)lantsa ‘iron’)
palantsahin
Pronunciation:

(a) Bases with long penultimate vowels:
If the base has two syllables, the derived noun shows one of two patterns: (1) length on both the
penultimate and final base vowels; (2) length on neither.

(1) ffa:wi:tin/ (/’a:wit/)
(2) faralin/ (/’a:ral/)
flinisin{
(/li:nis/)
fli:ni:sin{
flutu’in/
(/lu:to’/)
lu:tu:’in/

Speakers may differ as to which of these two patterns they use for a given derived noun, and in some cases
a single speaker may use the two patterns as free alternates. For bases of three or more syllables, see (b),
immediately below.
(b) Bases with no long vowels:

The normal vowel-length patterns of disyllabic bases are the same as those for B + -ant formations,
classes (1) and (2) above. Bases of three or more syllables have the same vowel-length patterns as in Class
(2) B +-an formations, whether or not the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is long.

fa:la(:)ga:’in} (/'ala:ga’/)
{bi:li:hin} (/bilih/)
/burda:hin{ (/burdah/)
/kumpu(:)ni:hin/ (/kumpunih/)
/ga:wa:’in} (/gawa’/)
/p(a:)lantsa:hin/ (/p(a)la:ntsah/)

Remarks: There is at least one irregular formation: alalahanin j’alalaha(:)nin/ ‘something to worry
about’ (cf. mag-alala {ma’alalah/ ‘worry’).
(4) dup,- + B +-an

Meaning: an imitation of what the base designates.

Examples:

bahay-bahayan ‘doll house/*house (the game)’ (bahay ‘house’)
bulaklak-bulaklakan ‘artificial flower’ (bulaklak ‘flower’)
kabayu-kabayuhan “toy or imitation horse’ (kabayo “horse’)
libru-libruhan ‘imitation book’ (libro *book’)
pari-parian ‘pretended priest” (pare ‘priest’)

Pronunciation: The last vowel of the base is always long. All other base vowels are short. These rules
apply regardless of the presence or absence of inherent length in the citation form of the base. Examples
are:

/bahaybaha:yan/ (/ba:hay/)
/bulaklakbulakla:kan/ (/bulaklak/)
/kabayu:kabayu:han/ ({kaba:yoh/)
Aibru:libru:han/ (/libroh/)
{pari:pari:’an/ (/pa:re’/)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

(5) ka- + B

101

Meaning: a person (occasionally, a thing) reciprocally associated with another; the basis of
association varies with the meaning of the base and may be: (a) a place of residence, occupation, or origin;
(b) a quality; (c) membership in a group; (d) spatial position; (¢) participation in an activity.

Examples: The examples are arranged according to the classification given under Meaning.)

(a) kakwarto
kaopisina
kaprobinsya

(b) katimbang
katumbas

(c) kapartido

‘roommate’
‘officemate’
“person from the
same province”

‘something/someone of equal weight’

‘something of equal value”

“fellow party member’

(kuwarto ‘room’)
(opisina ‘office’)
(probinsya ‘province’)

(timbang ‘weight’)
(tumbas ‘value’)

(partido ‘party’)

karelihyon ‘co-religionist” (relihyon religion’)
(d) kaharap ‘someone/something facing’ (harap ‘front’)
katabi “someone/something beside’ (tabi ‘side’)
_ (e)  kalaro ‘playmate’ (laro ‘play’)
kausap ‘fellow conversationalist’ (usap ‘conversation’)

Remarks: There are a few irregular formations: ¢.g., kababayan ‘compatriot’ (bayan ‘country’), in
which a duplicating syllable occurs between the prefix and the base; kasambahay ‘housemate’ (bahay
‘house’), in which -sam- (probably from isa ‘one’ plus the linker -ng) occurs between the prefix and the
base.

(6) ka- + B+-an
Meaning: the class (of qualities) or group (of things/people instanced by what the base designates.

Examples:
kabanalan ‘devoutness’ (banal *devout’)
kabukiran ‘fields’ (bukid ‘field’)
kakapalan ‘thickness’ (kapal ‘thickness’)
kabundukan ‘mountains’ (bundok ‘mountain’)
kaintsikan “the Chinese’ (Intsik ‘(a) Chinese’)
kalungkutan ‘sadness’ (lungkot ‘sadness’)
kapangitan ‘ugliness’ (pangit ‘ugly’)
kapuluan ‘archipelago’ (pulo ‘island’)
karagatan ‘seas’ (dagat ‘sea’)
karalitaan ‘poverty’ (dalita ‘poverty’)
katagalugan “the Tagalogs’ (Tagalog ‘(a) Tagalog’)
katamaran ‘laziness’ (tamad ‘lazy’)
katangian ‘uniqueness’ (tangi ‘unique’)
katapangan ‘bravery’ (tapang ‘bravery’)

Pronunciation: If the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is long, there is normally a
shift of length to the last base vowel in the derived noun:

{kabuki:ran/ (/bu:kid/)
/kapani:tan/ ({pa:nit/)
fkatagalu:an/ (/taga:log/)
{katapa:nan/ ({ta:pan/)

 

s d'auteur
102 CHAPTER 3

(There are some exceptions:

/karagatan/ ({da:gat/)
fkata:ni:an/ (fta:ni’/))

If the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is short, the derived noun shows one or the other
of the following patterns:

(1) short penultimate and final base vowels:

{kakapalan/ ({kapal/)
/ka’intsikan/ (intsik/)
/kapulu’an/ (/pulo’/)
{kara:lita’an/ ({da:lita’/)

(2) a long final base vowel preceded by a long or short penultimate base vowel, according to whether
the penultimate base vowel is or is not syllable-final:

/kaba:na:lan{ ({banal/)
{kabundu:kan/ (fbundok/)
{kaluxku:tan/ ([uxkot/)
{kata:ma:ran/ ({tamad/)

There are many derived nouns that are pronounced according to the first of these patterns by some
speakers, according to the second by others. And there are also many that show alternation between the
two patterns in the speech of a single speaker. It is probably the case, however, that the first pattern is the
more common.

Remarks: Virtually any unaffixed adjective or ma-adjective base (cf. §§4.2 and 4.3) may occur in
this formation. (In the case of ma-adjective bases — e.g., Kapal, lungkot, tapang — there is usually little
difference in meaning between the base itself and the derived noun.) The occurrence or non-occurrence of
bases of other types is not susceptible to generalization. There is, for example, no *kahapunan (cp. Hapon
*(a) Japanese’) paralleling kaintsikan.

There is at least one irregular formation: Katotohanan /katotoha:nan/ ‘truth’ (cf. totoo {toto oh/
“true’).

(7) mag- + B

Meaning: two relatives, one of whom bears to the other the relation designated by the base. (The

relation is reciprocal when the base designates a relative of the same generation.)

Examples:
mag-ama ‘father and child’ (ama ‘father’)
mag-asawa ‘husband and wife’ (asawa ‘spouse’)
mag-ina ‘mother and child’ (ina “mother’)
magkapatid ‘(two) siblings’ (kapatid ‘sibling’)
magpinsan ‘(two) cousins’ (pinsan ‘cousin’)

Remarks: Bases that occur in this formation designate relatives either of an older generation or of the
same generation. Bases that designate relatives of a younger generation — e.g., anak ‘child’ — do not occur
in the formation.

(8) mag- + dup,- + B

Meaning: three or more relatives, one of whom bears to the others the relation designated by the
base. (The relation is reciprocal when the base designates a relative of the same generation.)

Examples: mag-aama ‘father and children,’ magkakapatid ‘(three or more) siblings,’ and, in general,
all formations that result from inserting dup, - after the mag- of derived nouns of class (7).

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 103

(9) mag- + dup,;-+ B

Meaning: vendor of the product designated by the base.

Examples:
magbababoy ‘pig/pork vendor’ (baboy ‘pig/pork’)
magbubulaklak ‘flower vendor’ (bulaklak ‘flower’)
magkakandila ‘candle vendor’ (kandila ‘candle*)
magmamanok ‘chicken vendor’ (manok ‘chicken’)
magpupulot ‘honey vendor’ (ulot ‘honey’)

Pronunciation: If the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is long, this vowel is
shortened in the derived noun:

/magbababoy/ ({ba:boy/)
{magkakandila’/ (/kandi:la’/)

If the penultimate vowel of the citation form of the base is short, the base pronunciation is in most cases
retained in the derived noun:

{magbubulaklak/ (foulaklak/)
{magpupulot/ (/pulot/)

Ina few cases, some speakers lengthen an originally-short penultimate base vowel:

/magmama:nok/
({manok/)

/magmamanok/

(10) miag- + dup,- + ka- + B

Meaning: three or more people/things, each of whom/which may be characterized in relation to the
others, by the ka- + B derived noun (see class (5), above) included in the formation.

Examples: magkakakwurto ‘(three or more) roommates,’ magkakatumbas ‘(three or more) things of
equal value,” and, in general, all formations that result from prefixing :nag- + dup,- to derived nouns of class
(5).

(11) mag. + ka- + B

Meaning: two people/things, each of whom/which may be characterized, in relation to the other, by
the ka- + B derived noun (see class (5) above) included in the formation.

Examples: magkakwarto ‘(two) roommates’, magkatumbas’ (two) things of equal value” and, in
general, all formations that result from prefixing snag- to derived nouns of class (5).

(12) mang- + dup,-+ B
Meaning: a person associated — in most cases, professionally — with what the base designates.

Examples:
mamamahayag “reporter” (pahayag ‘announcement’)
mamamayan ‘citizen’ (bayan ‘country’)
mambabasa ‘reader’ (basa ‘read’)
mananahi “dressmaker” (tahi ‘sew’)
manananggol ‘lawyer (tanggol ‘defend’)
mananayaw ‘dancer’ (sayaw ‘dance’)
mandarambong ‘bandit’ (dambong ‘armed robbery’)
manlalaro “player (laro ‘play’)
mang-aawit “singer” (awit ‘song’)
mangangalakal ‘businessman’ (kalakal ‘business’)
manghahalal ‘voter’ (halal ‘vote’)
mangingibig ‘lover" (ibig ‘love’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
104 CHAPTER 3

Pronunciation: In formations involving the nominal prefix mang-, as in those involving the
homophonous verbal prefix (cf. §5.2, Subsection (12)), certain assimilatory changes occur. Base-initial
{p,t.s.k/ are regularly replaced by their homorganic-nasal counterparts: /p/>/m/, /t,s/>/n/, /k/>-n}.
Basc-initial /b,/ are in some cases replaced by nasals, in others not. When the replacement occurs, /b/>/m/,
(i-{n]. (A nasal that replaces /p,t,s,k,b,’/ is treated as the base-initial consonant in duplication.) The final
{nf of the prefix is dropped before a nasal consonant, and is replaced by /m/ before /b/, by /n/ before /d,l/.
These changes, most of which are illustrated in the examples above, may be summarized as follows:

$i }
im/ mf
mang- + dup,- + itt —>/maj + dup,- +
Is} Inf
Inf

tkf

Inf
Inf
fo +dup,-+ /m/

or
/mam/ + dup,- + /b/

{er dup,- + /nf
mang + dup,- + /'/> or
{manf + dup,-+ /'/
{| ("
mang + dup,- + —>/man/ + dup,-+
ft fl}

The /a/ of the prefix is long when it is syllable-final (i.e., when the /n/ of the prefix is lost before
another nasal, as explained above); otherwise it is short. A long penultimate vowel in the citation form of
the base is regularly shortened in the derived noun if the /a/ of the prefix is long:

/ma*mamahayag/ (/paha-yag/)
/ma‘nanalakal/ (/kala-kal/)

(There are some exceptions: e.g., /ma‘nini‘big/(‘i*big).) If the /a/ of the prefix is short, vowel length in the
base is retained.

/man’a‘a‘wit} (/‘a'wit/)

A syllable-final short vowel in the penultimate syllable of the base is regularly lengthened in the
derived noun:

/ma:nana‘yaw/ ({sayaw/)
/manlala‘ro’/ (flaro’/)

(There are some exceptions: e.g., /manhahalal/ (/halal/).) A non-syllable-final short vowel is not
lengthened:

/ma‘nanangol/ (/tangol/)

Remarks: Certain derived nouns in this class may be followed by ng phrases that correspond to the
ng-phrase object complements taken by actor-focus verbs formed with the same base: e.g.,

mambabasa ng diyaryo (cf. bumasa ng dyaryo

‘reader of newspapers’ ‘read a newspaper’)

manlalaro ng besbol (cf. maglaro ng besbol

‘baseball player’ ‘play baseball’)

(13) pa- +B

Meaning: a thing upon or toward which the action designated by the base is caused to be directed.
Examples:
paabot ‘something caused to be handed over’ (abot ‘hand over’)
padala ‘something caused to be brought’ (dala ‘bring’)
pagawa ‘something caused to be made’ (gawa ‘make’)
paluto ‘something caused to be cooked’ (luto ‘cook’)
patago ‘something caused to be kapt’ (tago ‘keep’)

Remarks: This formation is normally followed by a ng phrase expressing the person who causes the
action to be performed, and frequently followed by asa phrase expressing the performer: ¢.g., -

Paluto ni Pedro sa nanay ang bibingka.

‘The bibingka is what Pedro asked Mother to cook?”
lyon ba ang pagawa mo sa sapatero?

‘Is that what you’re having the shoemaker make?’

The pa- that occurs in this formation is related to the pa- that occurs in indirect-action verbs (cf.
§5.12).
(14) taga-+B

Meaning: a person from the place designated by the base.

Examples:

taga-Amerika ‘person from America’ (Amerika ‘America’)

taga-Cebu ‘person from Cebu’ (Cebu ‘Cebu’)

taga-Maynila ‘person from Manila’ (Maynila ‘Manila’)
taga-Pilipinas ‘person from the Philippines’ —_ (Pilipinas ‘Philippines’)
taga-San Francisco ‘person from San Francisco’ —_ (San Francisco ‘San Francisco’)

Remarks: In addition to nouns representing specific places, the interrogative word saan (cf. §7.10)
and the sa forms of deictic pronouns occur as bases in this formation:

Taga-saan ba kayo? Taga-rito.
‘Where are you from?’ ‘From here’

(Literally: *You are a person from where?’ ‘A person from here.’)
(15) taga- +B

Meaning: a person employed or delegated to perform the action designated by the related verb
(normally an -un- verb — see Remarks) formed with the same base.

Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

tagabili ‘buyer’ (bumili ‘buy’)
tagakuha ‘taker’ (kumuha ‘take’)
tagaluto ‘cook’ (magluto *cook’)
tagasagot ‘answerer’ (sumagot ‘answer’)
tagasulat ‘writer’ (sumulat ‘write’)

106 CHAPTER 3

Remarks: The great majority of the bases that occur in this formation also occur as bases of -tam-
verbs. A few of the bases that occur in this formation — e.g., luto ‘cook’ — occur as bases of mag-verbs,
rather than of -wm-verbs; in these cases, the taga- + B formation alternates freely with a taga- + pag- + B
formation — see Class (16).

Derived nouns in this class may take the same ng-phrase object complements as do the related verbs
formed with the same base: e.g.,

tagakuha ng litrato (cf. kumuha ng Jitrato
‘picture taker’ ‘take a picture’)
tagasagot ng telepono (cf. sumagot ng telepono
‘telephone answerer’ ‘answer a telephone’)

(16) taga- + pag- + B
Meaning: a person employed or delegated to perform the action designated by the mag- verb formed
with the same base.

Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

tagapagbili ‘seller’ (magbili ‘sell’)
tagapaghugas ‘washer* (maghugas ‘wash’)
tagapaglaba ‘launderer’ (maglaba ‘launder’)
tagapagluto ‘cook’ (magluto ‘cook’)
tagapagturo ‘teacher* (magturo ‘teacher’)

Remarks: Derived nouns in this class may take the same ng-phrase object complements as do the
related verbs formed with the same base: e.g.,

tagapaghugas ng pinggan (cf. maghugas ng pinggan
‘dish washer’ ‘wash a dish’)
tagapagturo ng Ingles (cf. magturo ng Ingles
“English teacher’ “teach English’)

(17) taga- + pang- + B

Meaning: a person employed or delegated to perform the action designated by the mang- verb
formed with the same base.

Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

tagapamili ‘shopper’ (mamili ‘shop’)
tagapamintuho *(delegated) wooer’ (mamintuho ‘woo’)
tagapanghiram ‘borrower’ (manghiram ‘borrow’)
tagapangahoy ‘wood-gatherer’ (mangahoy ‘gather wood’)
tagapangisda ‘fisherman’ (mangisda fish’)

Pronunciation: Any assimilatory changes evidenced in the related mang- verb (cf. §5.2, Subsection
(12)) are also evidenced in the derived noun.

Remarks: Derived nouns in this class may take the same ng- phrase object complements as do the
related verbs formed with the same base: e.g.,

‘clothing shopper’ ‘shop for clothing’)
tagapanghiram ng pera (cf. manghiram ng pera

§3.8. Nominal compounds.

A COMPOUND may be defined, for practical purposes, as a word composed of two potentially
distinct words; a NOMINAL COMPOUND, as a compound that functions as a nominal. Tagalog nominal
compounds differ from the derived noun formations dealt with in §3.7 in several ways. In the first place,
both the components of nominal compounds are capable of occurring independently, as distinct words,
while at least one component of a derived noun is a prefix or a suffix that occurs only in complex
formations. Thus, while both the components of the nominal compound bagoong-Balayan ‘pickled fish
from Balayan’ (bagoong ‘pickled fish’, Balayan ‘Balayan’) may occur as independent words, only the second
component of the derived noun taga-Balayan ‘person from Balayan’ may do so. Nominal compounds also
differ from derived nouns in that they involve the device of LINKING. Linking is the connecting of the
elements of a word or construction by means of a special connecting element, or LINKER. The linker has
as its sole function the indication of a relation between the elements it connects, and has no meaning apart
from the indication of this relation.

Linking is a characteristic device of Tagalog grammar, and occurs in a number of constructions apart
from compounds. Tagalog has two important linkers (besides coordinating conjunctions — cf. § §3.10 and
7.19), which may be called the linker -ng and the linker na/-ng. The characteristics of the linker na/-ng are
presented in detail in §3.11. The linker -ng, which is the only linker that occurs in compounds has one
overt form and one ZERO FORM: i.e., a form without phonemic representation. The overt form of the
linker occurs if the first of the two elements it connects ends (in its independent form) with one of the
three consonants /h/, /’/, or /nj. In this case the linker consists of the replacement of the final consonant by
In} (represented by -ng in conventional spelling). Note the following examples of nominal compounds
whose first elements, in their independent forms, end in /h/, /"/, and {n/:

mata +-ng + lawin matang-lawin
{matah/ fla:win} /matanla:win/
‘eye(s)’ ‘hawk’ (‘eyes like a hawk’s’)

‘keen eyes’

nguso + -ng + baboy ngusong-baboy

{nu:so’} [ba:boy/ Jnu:sunba:boy/

‘upper Jip’ ‘pig’ Cupper lip like a pig’s’)
‘protruding upper lip’

ngipin +-ng + aso ngiping-aso

{ni:pin} Pa:soh{ {nipin’a:soh/

‘tooth/tecth’ “dog” (‘teeth like a dog’s’)

‘sharp teeth’

The zero form of the linker -ng occurs if the first linked element ends in any consonant other than
(hi, ['/, or {nj. In effect, the resultant formation consists merely of the two linked elements in their
independent forms. But a zero form of a linker — rather than the absence of a linker — is posited because of
the otherwise perfect parallelism with formations involving the replacement of /h/, /’/, or /n/ by /n/. Thus,
for example, silid-kainan ‘dining room’ and mesang-kainan ‘dining table’ are obviously similar compound
formations, although the first (whose components are silid {silid/ ‘room’ and kainan /ka’inan/ ‘eating place’)
involves no overt linker, while the second (whose components are mesa /me:sah/ ‘table’ and Kainan) does.

Some other examples of compounds involving the zero form of the linker -ng are:

isip +-ng + lamok isip-lamok

fitsip/ flamok/ f'i:siplamok/

‘mind’ ‘mosquito’ (‘mind like a mosquito’s’)
‘weak mind”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
108 CHAPTER 3

boses + -ng + ipis boses-ipis
{bo:ses/ Li:pis/ /bo:ses’i:pis/
‘voice’ ‘cockroach’ (voice like a cockroach’s)

“weak voice’

lakad + -ng + pagong lakad-pagong
fla:kad/ /pago:n/ fla:kapa:gon/
‘walk’ “turtle” (‘walk like a turtle’s’)

‘slow walk”

Just as nominal compounds differ in several ways from derived nouns, so also do they differ in several
ways from the modification constructions dealt with in §§3.11, ff. One of these ways is that modification
constructions involve the linker na/-ng, rather than the linker -ng. As is explained in §3.11, the linker
na/-ng has the form /naf (spelled na) after a consonant other than /h/, /'/, or {n/. Therefore, when the first
element of a modification construction ends in a consonant other than /h/, /’/, or /n/, there is an overt
difference between it and an otherwise identical nominal compound. Compare, for example, the
modification construction anak na mayaman ‘rich child’ and the nominal compound anak-mayaman ‘person
born to wealth’. The components of the modification construction and those of the compound — anak
‘child’ and mayaman ‘rich’ — are the same but the resultant formations are differentiated by the presence of
na in the first, its absence in the second.

When the first element of a modification construction ends, in its independent form, in /h/, f*/, or
{nj, there is no overt difference between the modification construction and a compound with the same
components. For the linker na/-ng and the linker -ng both have the same phonemic realization in such
cases: viz., the replacement of the final consonant by /n/. Thus the modification construction barong
pamparti ‘dress wom at a party’ and the nominal compound barong-pamparti ‘party dress’ are
homophonous. (The elements in both cases are baro /ba:ro / ‘dress’ and pamparti /pampa:rtih/ ‘used/wom
at a party’.

Nominal compounds, then, are not always distinguishable from modification constructions on the
basis of form. There are, however, a number of other ways in which the two may be distinguished. For
example, the elements of a modification construction may be separated from one another by certain
strictures —e.g., a possessive ng pronoun (cf. §3.20)— while those of a nominal compound are
inseparable. Thus: baro mong pamparti ‘your dress worn at a party’, but barong-pamparti mo ‘your party

dress’. Also, the order of elements within nominal compounds is fixed, while that in modification
constructions is, in gencral, reversible. Thus the modification construction barong pamparti is matched by a

construction of identical meaning but reversed word order, pamparting baro dress worn at a party’; but
there is no nominal compound “pamparting-baro.

Another, and very important, difference between nominal compounds and modification
constructions lies in the semantic relation that obtains between the two linked elements, and the semantic
relation between these elements and the resultant formation. The semantic relation that obtains between
elements linked in a simple modification construction (i.e., a two-component modification construction) is
essentially the same for all such constructions. This is because, as is explained in §3.11, one of the
components of a simple modification construction always corresponds to the predicate of a basic sentence
and the other to its topic. And, since the relation between the predicate and the topic is always essentially
an equational one (cf. §2.2), so is the relation between the elements of the simple modification
construction. Thus in a modification construction like anak na mayaman (or mayamang anak) ‘rich child’
mayaman ‘rich’ is equated or identified with anak ‘child’ just as it is in the corresponding basic sentence
Mayaman ang anak ‘The child is rich’.

The elements of a nominal compound, on the other hand, while they in some cases stand in an
equational relation to one another, may also stand in one of a number of other kinds of semantic relations.
Thus the semantic relation implicit in the compound anak-mayaman ‘person born to wealth’ is a possessive
one (‘child of the rich’), as is that in the compound matang-lawin ‘kecn eyes’ (‘eyes like a hawk’s’); the
semantic relation implicit in the compound tubig-ulan ‘rain water’ is that of object to source (‘water (tubig)
from rain (ulan)’), as is that in sukang iloko ‘vinegar (suka) from the Ilocos (Moko)’; etc. (A fuller treatment
of the semantic relations that obtain between the elements of nominal compounds is presented on the
following page.)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 109

The semantic relation of the elements of compounds to the compounds themselves also shows a wider
Tange than does the selation of the elements of modification constructions to the constructions. The
meaning of a modification construction can always be inferred from that of its elements. Thus the meaning
of the modification construction bahay na malaki ‘big house’ is directly inferable from the meanings of
bahay ‘house’ and malaki ‘big’ — given, of course, the equational meaning implicit in modification
constructions in general. In the case of nominal compounds, on the other hand, the meaning of the
compound may or may not be inferable from the meanings of the elements, even when the semantic
relation between the elements (which, as noted above, may vary) is known. Thus while the meaning of
bahay-pukyutan ‘beehive’ can be inferred from the meaning of its elements (bahay ‘house’, pukyutan
‘honeybee’) once it is known that there is a possessive relation between the clements, the meanings of
certain other compounds involving a possessive relation cannot be inferred from the meaning of the
elements. For example, busgang-araw ‘prickly heat’ probably reflects a possessive relation between bunga
‘fruit’ and araw ‘sun’ (‘fruit of the sun’), but the meaning of the compound is not inferable from the
meanings of the elements plus the meaning of possession. And even in such a case as matang-lawin, the
meaning of the compound cannot be directly inferred from the meaning of the elements plus the meaning
of possession, for the compound does not mean ‘hawk’s eyes’ (which would be expressed by the possessive
construction mata ng lavin — cf. §3.20), but, rather, eyes dike a hawk’s’ or ‘keen eyes’.

Some of the more productive classes of nominal compounds in Tagalog are illustrated below. The
basis of classification is the semantic relation that probably obtains between the elements of the
compounds. (No attempt is made to subdivide the classes according to the semantic relations of the
elements of the compounds to the compounds themselves, but since the meanings of the elements as well as
of the compounds are given, the range of such relations within each class may to some extent be inferred
from the examples listed.) Each listed compound is followed by a gloss of its elements and then by a
translation.

(1) Descriptive: The second element of the compound describes or specifies the first. In some cases
the first clement represents a genus, the second a species; in others, the second element represents the
material of which the first is composed; in others, an equational relationship obtains.

One general fact about the order of elements within Tagalog nominal compounds in relation to that
within English nominal compounds emerges from the above examples: viz., that in cases where the two
languages have compounds with similar elements and similar meanings, the order of elements within the
Tagalog compounds is usually the reverse of that in the English compounds. Thus: punong-mangga (puno
‘tree’, mangga ‘mango’) versus ‘mango tree’; pamatid-uhaw (pamatid ‘used for cutting’, uhaw ‘thirst’) versus
‘thirst-quencher’; bahay-paaralan (bahay ‘house’, paaralan ‘school’) versus ‘schoolhouse’; bahay-pukyutan
(bahay ‘house’, pukyutan ‘honeybee’) versus ‘beehive’; tubig-ulan (tubig ‘water’, ulan ‘rain’) versus ‘rain

water’.

(In addition to nominal compounds, Tagalog also has certain compound adjectives and compound
verb bases. These compounds resemble nominal compounds both in their formation, which involves the
linker -ng, and in the kinds of semantic relations that obtain between their elements. Thus a possessive

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS ll

relation is implicit in such compound adjectives as amoy-isda (amoy ‘odor’, isda ‘fish’) ‘smelling of fish’ or
1 s ° . < . . ?

lasang-isda (lasa ‘taste’, isda ‘fish’) ‘tasting of fish’, an object relation in the bases of such verbs as
magbigay-galang (bigay ‘giving’, galang ‘respect’) ‘show respect’ or magbangong-puri (bangon ‘raise’, puri
‘honor’) ‘redeem one’s honor’, etc. Because of the similarity of compound adjectives and compound verb
bases to nominal compounds, no further treatment of the adjectives and verbs is included in this text.)

§3.9. Pluralization of nominals.

Tagalog has devices for pluralizing nouns, deictic, personal, and interrogative pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adjective phrases. Thus Tagalog has a wider range of plural formations than does English, in
which only nouns, personal and deictic pronouns, and verbs have distinctive plurals. The number
distinctions of English, however, have a more central role in the language than the number distinctions of
Tagalog. In the first place, obligatory choices between singular and plural formations are common in
English, but rare in Tagalog. In English, for example, a speaker must make a choice between expressing the
plural in the case of most common nouns. If he says the book, he is clearly referring to one object; if he
says the books, to more than one. In Tagalog, on the other hand, although there is a way of explicitly
pluralizing most unmarked nouns, the pluralization of a noun need not — and, in some cases in fact,
cannot -- be formally signaled if the context makes the plural meaning clear, Without context the sentence
Nasa mesa ang libro means ‘The book is on the table’. But the same sentence can be used to mean ‘The
books are on the table’ in a situation where both the speaker and the hearer know that more than one book
is being referred to. (The insertion of the word mga ({manah/) before libro would make the plural meaning
explicit — see below).

In English there are also certain obligatory number agreements between the subject and the predicate
of a sentence: The man is a lawyer{The men are lawyers. In Tagalog there is, in general, no obligatory
number agreement between the predicate and the topic. Either the predicate alone, the topic alone, or both
may in most cases be pluralized:

Mga abogado ang lalaki.
Abogado ang mga lalaki. ‘The men are lawyers.”
Mga abogado ang mga lalaki.

There are, however, a few cases of obligatory number agreement — as well as of obligatory absence of
number agreement — which are discussed below.

Plurality in Tagalog is expressed through a variety of grammatical devices. In the case of personal
pronouns and certain personal-noun phrases, it is expressed by distinctive plural forms; in that of
interrogative words and certain adjectives, by duplication. In other cases specific pluralizing affixes are
used. Elsewhere its most common expression involves the word sga, which adds the meaning of plurality to
the sentence element that follows it.

The plural forms of personal pronouns are presented in §3.3; those of interrogative words, in §7.7.
Plural noun and verb affixes are presented in § §3.9 and 5.14 respectively; the pluralization of adjectives, in
$4.11. The present section deals first with the use of »ga as a pluralizer of unmarked nouns, deictic
pronouns, and personal nouns, then with the pluralization of personal-noun markers.

Mga is a conventional spelling for phonemic /manah/. This word, which is a PROCLITIC (i.c., does
not occur phrase finally), has two different meanings — approximative and plural — according to the type
of construction in which it occurs, Afga is approximative when it occurs with a cardinal number or witha

time expression. In its approximative meaning snga translates English ‘approximately’, ‘about’, or
‘around’: miga sampu ‘approximately ten’; mga ala una ‘about one o'clock’; sa mga buwan ng Encro

‘around the month of January’. (The approximative use of mga is discussed in § §4.4 and 6.8.) In all other
Cases niga adds a plural meaning to the sentence element that follows it.

Mga occurs in its plural meaning with unmarked nouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns. (Plural
mga also occurs with adjectives — cf. §4.11 — and with nominalized verbals and adjective phrases — ef.
§3.24.) Normally, it immediately precedes what it pluralizes:

mga librong para sa bata ‘books for the child/children’
librong para sa mga bata ‘a book/books for the children’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

112 CHAPTER 3

(When mga is used to pluralize a modification construction in which the modifier precedes the
head — cf. §3.11 — mga may precede either the entire construction or the head. Thus:

mga para sa batang libro

“books for the child.’)
para sa batang mga libro

In the case of unmarked nouns, Tagalog makes a distinction between pluralizable and unpluralizable
nouns that is like a distinction made in English. Some English nouns, e.g., table and party, have distinct
plural forms, while others — ¢.g., frmiture and fun — normally do not. Similarly in Tagalog there are some
nouns that occur freely with mga and others that normally do not. The two classes of nouns may be called
COUNT and MASS nouns respectively, following the usage of English grammarians.

In general, Tagalog count nouns correspond to English count nouns, and refer to items that are
perceived as discrete units: e.g., balay ‘house’. baro ‘dress’, bata ‘child’. Similarly, Tagalog mass nouns
generally correspond to English mass nouns, and refer to items that are not normally perceived as discrete
units: e.g., alikabok ‘dust’, asin ‘salt’, aso ‘smoke’. In some cases, however, the Tagalog
translation-equivalent of an English mass noun is a pluralized count noun: mga balita ‘news’, mga
kasangkapan ‘furniture’, mga mateta ‘baggage (bags)’. (Some speakers occasionally use mga with a mass
noun (1) to express the idea of several masses: e.g., nga alikabok ‘heaps of dust’ or (2) with the implied
deletion of a count noun: ¢.g., ga tubig, short for mga baso ng tubis ‘glasses of water’.

When a deictic pronoun is pluralized by mga, the ang form of the deictic is used in all cases, and the

function of the deictic in the sentence is indicated by a marker (ang, ng, or sa) before the mga, rather than
by a change in the form of the deictic itself. Thus:

Silya ito but Silya ang mga ito

‘This is a chair.” ‘These are chairs.’

Gumawa niyan si Pedro. but Gumawa ng mga iyan si Pedro.

‘Pedro made (some of) that.’ ‘Pedro made (some of) those.’

Para doon ang mga kasangkapan. but Para sa mga iyon ang mga kasangkapan.
‘The furniture is for that (place).’ ‘The furniture is for those (places).”

Mga does not occur with personal nouns preceded by the personal markers si, ni, and kay. It does,
however, occur with personal nouns preceded by ang, ng, and sa, in which case it conveys the meaning of
several people with the same name (often a family):

Heto na ang mga Santos. “Here come the Santoses.”
Kamag-anak siya ng mga Santos. ‘He’s a relative of the Santoses.’

There are certain contexts in which sga may not occur as a pluralizer of a nominal. It may not occur
with the topic of a sentence whose predicate is a cardinal number. Thus:

Sampu ang anak niya “His children are ten (in number).’
(‘He has ten children.’)

not
*Sampu ang mga anak niya.
Similarly, mga does not pluralize a word or phrase modified by a cardinal number (cf. §3.13). In mga
sampung anak, for example, mga is approximative, and the meaning of the phrase is ‘about ten children’.

‘Ten children’ is simply sampung anak, without mga. As was mentioned above, mga docs not occur after the
personal-noun markers si, ni, and kay. These markers may, however, themselves be pluralized. The plural

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 113

markers are formed by adding -na to the singulars. In the case of kay, there is also a change of vowel from
fay to fif. Thus:

Singular Marker Plural Marker
si sina
ni nina
kay kina

A phrase consisting of a plural marker and a personal noun means: the person named by the noun
and another or others associated with that person. Thus, sina Maria has the general meaning ‘Maria and
(the) other(s)’. In specific instances it might mean ‘Maria and her friend(s)’, ‘maria and her companion(s)’,
“Maria and her relative(s)’, etc. Some examples of pluralized person-noun phrases are:

Masasaya na sina Maria. ‘Maria and the others are happy now.”
Siya ang lola nina Boy. ‘She is the grandmother of Boy and the others.’
Para kina Luis ang handaan. ‘The party is for Luis and the others.’

It should be noted that personal nouns occur in two different types of plural constructions: a
construction involving mga after ang, ng, or sa, and the construction just described, involving the plural
personal-noun markers. These two plural constructions have different meanings. The nga construction is
used to designate two or more people with the same name, while the plural-marker construction is used to
designate the person named plus other people. Thus ang mga Santos is ‘the Santoses’, while sina Santos is
‘Santos and others (who may or may not also be named Santos)’.

The plural personal-noun markers also occur in coordinate nominal constructions (cf. §3.10),
preceding two personal names linked by at ‘and’, or more than two personal names, the last two of which
(at least) are linked by at. In these constructions, the plural marker is used as a free alternant of repeated
singular markers. Thus sina Pedro at Maria ‘Pedro and Maria’ is equivalent to si Pedro at si Maria, nina Bob,
Ed, at Ben ‘(of) Bob, Ed, and Ben’ to ni Bob, ni Ed, at ni Ben, etc. In coordinate constructions such as

these, there is no implication of ‘and others’, as there is where the plural marker precedes a single personal
noun,

§3.10. Coordinate nominal constructions.

COORDINATION is a grammatical device for combining elements of two sentences, which may be
called UNDERLYING SENTENCES, into a single new sentence: a RESULTANT SENTENCE. A sentence
that results from coordination contains a COORDINATE CONSTRUCTION, which consists of two (or
more) COORDINATES linked by a COORDINATING CONJUNCTION. An example of an English
coordinate construction may clarify the relation between the underlying and the resultant sentences in
coordination. In the example, the resultant sentence contains the coordinate construction ‘Bill and John"
which consists of the coordinates ‘Bill’ and ‘John’ and the coordinating conjunction ‘and’.

‘I saw Bill yesterday.’
Underlying Sentences:
‘I saw John yesterday.”

Resultant Sentence: ‘I saw Bill and John yesterday.”

In Tagalog, as in English, many different kinds of structures may serve as coordinates, ranging from
single words through phrases to entire sentences. A discussion of the full range of coordinate constructions
in Tagalog is reserved for §7.19. The present section treats only coordinate nominal constructions (i.e.,
constructions in which the coordinates are nominals), which have certain peculiarities that warrant separate
discussion. A full listing of coordinating conjunctions is also reserved for §7.19. In the present section, only
at ‘and’ is dealt with.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
114 CHAPTER 3

When two unmarked nouns are coordinated by at, the resultant coordinate construction may or may
not include a repetition of a marker (ang, ng, or sa) before the second noun. Thus, from the underlying
sentences Nakita ko ang babae ‘I saw the woman’ and Nakita ko ang lalaki ‘| saw the man’, may result in
either of the following:

ang lalaki.
Nakita ko ang babae at

lalaki.
‘I saw the woman and (the) man."

Some other examples are:

ng kape.
Uminom sila ng tsa at

kape.
‘They drank tea and coffee.’

sa Negros.
Pupunta siya sa Cebu at

Negros.

‘He'll go to Cebu and Negros.”
(Both the coordinate nouns may occur without marker in appropriate contexts: e.g.,

Asin at sili ang kailangan ko.
‘What I need is salt and pepper.)

When, on the other hand, either of the coordinated nominals is a marked noun, the second nominal
must normally be preceded by the appropriate marker or must be in the appropriate marked form. (See
below, however, for the replacement of repeated singular personal-noun markers by a plural marker.) Thus,
from the underlying sentences Nakita ko si Juan ‘1 saw Juan’ and Nakita ko ang lalaki ‘1 saw the man’, can
result only:

Nakita ko si Juan at ang lalaki.
‘I saw Juan and the man.’

There is no:
*Nakita ko si Juan at lalaki.
Similarly, if the order of the coordinates is reserved, the resultant sentence must be:

Nakita ko ang lalaki at si Juan.
‘I saw the man and Juan."

Not:
Nakita ko ang lalaki at Juan.

Some other examples of coordinate nominal constructions that include marked nouns are:

Nakita ko si Juan at si Ben.
‘I saw Juan and Ben.’

Gusto ko iyan at ang iba.
‘I like that one and the other one.”

Pinili niya ako at si Joe.
‘He chose me and Joe.*

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 11S

Ginawa iyon ni Maria at ng kaibigan niya.
‘Marie and her friend made that.’

Darating sila dito at sa paaralan.
‘They'll come here and to the school.”

Coordinate nominal constructions involving three or more coordinates linked by ar also follow, in
general, the rules given above for repetition of markers, etc. In such a sequence a marker is, however,
optionally deletable before the second of two consecutive coordinate unmarked nouns, regardless of
whether the sequence of coordinates also includes a marked noun. Thus:

ang lalaki
Nakita ko ang babae at at si Juan.
lalaki
‘I saw the woman and (the) man and Juan.”
ang lalaki.
Nakita ko si Juan at ang babae at
lataki

‘I saw Juan and the woman and (the) man.’

If the two unmarked nouns are not consecutive, however, the marker before the second may not be
deleted. Thus:

Nakita ko ang babae at si Juan at ang lalaki.
‘I saw the woman and Juan and the man.”

but not:

*Nakita ko ang babae at si Juan at lalaki.

(As in English, all but the last of the coordinating conjunctions in a construction with three or more
coordinates may optionally be replaced by a pause. Thus, also, Nakita ko ang babae, si Juan, at ang lalaki.)

As was mentioned in §3.9, a plural personal-noun marker (sina, nina, kina) may replace repeated
singular markers in coordinate constructions involving two or more coordinate personal nouns linked by af.
Therefore, as an alternative to Nakita ko si Juan at si Ben {at si Joe) may occur:

Nakita ko sina Juan at Ben (at Joe).
*L saw Juan and Ben (and Joe).”

Similarly:

ni Belen at ni Rosa

Pinanood ang parada.
nina Belen at Rosa

‘Belen and Rosa watched the parade.”

‘Pll write to Mr. Reyes and Mrs. Quizon.’

When the first of two potential coordinates is expressed by a personal pronoun and the second by a
nominal other than a personal pronoun, Tagalog in some cases allows, in others requires, the use of a
116 CHAPTER 3

SPECIAL COORDINATE CONSTRUCTION in place of the coordinate construction with at. This special
coordinate construction consists of a plural personal pronoun followed by a ng phrase (ng plus an
unmarked noun, mi or nina plus a personal noun, or the ng form of a deictic). If the underlying pronoun is
singular, the pronoun in the resultant sentence is its plural counterpart. Thus from the underlying sentences
Nakita ko siya ‘1 saw him’ and Nakita ko si Juan ‘| saw Juan’ is derived:

Nakita ko sila ni Juan.
‘I saw him and Juan.”

If the underlying pronoun is plural, the same pronoun occurs in the resultant sentence. Thus the
sentence Nakita ko sila ni Juan may also correspond to the underlying sentences Nekita ko sila ‘I saw them’
and Nakita ko si Juan ‘I saw Juan’, and may thus have the meaning ‘I saw them and Juan’ as well as the
meaning given above.

In the special coordinate construction the second coordinate is always expressed by a ng phrase,
whatever marker may precede this nominal in the underlying sentence. Thus:

Nakita ko sila ni Juan.
‘I saw him/them and Juan.”
(Underlying sentence: Nakita ko si Juan.)

Ginawa nila ni Juan ang trabaho.
‘He/They and Juan did the work.’
(Underlying sentence: Ginawa ni Juan ang trabaho.

Ibibigay ko ito sa kanila ni Juan.
‘Dll give this to him/them and Juan.’
(Underlying sentence: Ibibigay ko ito kay Juan.)

Some other examples of the special coordinate construction are:

Maglalakad kami ng Nanay.
‘Mother and I (and the others) will walk.’

Lilinisin natin nina Maria ang bahay.
“You (sg./pl.) and I and Maria and her friends will clean the house.’

Para sa inyo niyang batang iyan ang regalo.
‘The gift is for you and that child.”

A special coordinate construction is the most common way of expressing a grouping whose
membership includes at least one person designated by a personal pronoun and one designated by a nominal
not a personal pronoun. An avg or sa personal pronoun may, however, also occur in a coordinate
construction with at. Thus as alternatives to sentences with special coordinate constructions, may occur:

Nakita ko siya at si Juan.
‘L saw him and Juan.”

Ibibigay ko ito sa kaniya at kay Juan.
‘T'll give this to him and Juan.”

A ng personal pronoun, on the other hand, occurs rarcly, if at all, as a coordinate in a construction with at.

§3.11. Modification constructions: introduction.
Tagalog, like English, has a variety of constructions that involve the embedding of certain elements of
one sentence (hereafter, a CONSTITUENT SENTENCE) in another (hereafter, a MATRIX SENTENCE) to

 

teur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 117

produce a single new sentence (hereafter, a RESULTANT SENTENCE). The basic structure of the resultant
sentence is the same as that of the matrix sentence that underlies it, but in the resultant sentence, part of
the matrix sentence has been expanded — or, in some cases, replaced — by an clement or elements taken
from the constituent sentence. An example from English will serve to illustrate the relation between a
resultant sentence and the matrix and constituent sentences that underlie it:

Matrix sentence: The book is a novel.
Constituent sentence: The book is on the table.
Resultant sentence: The book on the table is a novel.

In the example, the resultant sentence has the same basic structure as the matrix sentence — subject: ‘the
book’; predicate: ‘is a novel’ — but ‘book’ has been expanded by a phrase, ‘on the table’, taken from the
constituent sentence.

The above example illustrates one of the most important classes of embedded
constructions: MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONS. Modification constructions are distinguished from
certain other embedded constructions by the retention within the resultant sentence of all the elements of
the underlying matrix sentence. Some types of embedded constructions — for example, the Tagalog
nominal clause constructions (cf. §3.28)— involve the replacement of part of the matrix sentence by
elements taken from the constituent sentence. But in a modification construction the matrix sentence is
retained intact, and elements taken from the constituent sentence are merely added to it, serving to expand
a given part of the matrix sentence (e.g., ‘book’ in the above English example.)

Strictly speaking, the term MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTION applies to that part of the resultant
sentence that consists of the element of the matrix sentence that has been expanded and the elements
(from the constituent sentence) by means of which it has been expanded. The modification construction in
‘The book on the table is a novel’ is thus ‘book on the table’. A modification construction consists of two
parts: a part common to the matrix sentence and the constituent sentence (hereafter, the HEAD), and a
part taken from the constituent sentence (hereafter, the MODIFIER). The two parts of ‘book on the table’
are: head, ‘book’; modifier, ‘on the table’.

Tagalog shows a great diversity of modification constructions from the point of view of the types of
heads and modifiers that occur. But in one important respect almost all Tagalog modification constructions
are alike. This is that—with the exception of certain constructions presented in §§3.19 and
3.20 ~ modifiers always correspond to the PREDICATE of the constituent sentence, while heads always
correspond to the TOPIC of the constituent sentence. In other words, the relation modifier-head in the
resultant sentence corresponds to the relation predicate-topic in the constituent sentence. To illustrate:

Matrix sentence: Nobela ang libro.
‘The book is a novel.”

Constituent sentence: Nasa mesa ang libro.
‘The book is on the table.’

Resultant sentence: Nobela ang librong nasa mesa.
‘The book on the table is a novel.”

The modification construction in the resultant sentence is librong nasa mesa. It includes the modifier nasa
mesa and the head libro. (The -ng after libro will be discussed below.) Note that in the constituent sentence
nasa mesa is the predicate while libro is in topic position. This same proportion — modifier is to head (in
the resultant sentence) as predicate is to topic (in the constituent sentence) — obtains in almost all Tagalog
modification constructions.

In English the relation predicate-subject is frequently reflected in the relation modificr-head. But this
relationship in English is less consistent than the Tagalog proportion just presented. Thus the head ‘book’ in
the modification construction ‘book | read’ corresponds to the object of the constituent sentence — ‘I read

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
118 CHAPTER 3

the book’ — rather than the subject, while the modifier ‘I read’ corresponds to the subject and a part of the
predicate. In the Tagalog modification construction librong binasa ko ‘book | read’, on the other hand, the
head libro and the modifier binaso ko correspond, as is usually the case, to the topic and predicate
respectively of the constituent sentence: Binasa ko ang libro ‘I read the book’.

There is a second respect in which — again with certain exceptions discussed in § §3.19 and 3.20 — all
Tagalog modification constructions are alike. This is in their use of the device of LINKING. (As was noted
in §3.8, linking is the connecting of two sentence elements by means of a third, called a LINKER, Which
has as its sole function the indication of a relation between the two elements it connects.) The elements of
Tagalog modification constructions are in the great majority of cases connected by the linker na/-ng, onc of
the two major linkers of Tagalog. (The characteristics of the other major linker, the linker -ng, are presented
in §3.8.)

The linker na/-ng has two different forms. The form that occurs in any given case is determined by
the final consonant of the independent form of the element that precedes the linker. If this final consonant
is /h/, /’/, or /n/, the consonant is replaced by /n/, which is represented in conventional writing by -ng at the
end of a word. For example:

mabuti /mabu:tih/ ‘good’ + linker na/-ng > mabuting /mabu:tin/
mayumi /mayu:mi / ‘modest’ + linker na/-ng - mayuming /mayu:min/
mayaman /maya:man/ ‘rich’ + linker na/-ng - mayamang /maya:man/

as in:

mayuming

mabuting
mayamang

good
tao ‘a modest person’
rich

If the final consonant is not /h/, /*/, or /n/, it is not replaced. Instead, it is followed by /na/, which is
represented in conventional spelling as a separate word, na. Thus:

masipag /masi:pag/ ‘diligent’ + linker na/-ng — masipag na /masi:pag na/
magalang /maga:lan/ ‘courteous’ + linker na/-ng > magalang na /maga:lan na/
matakaw /mata:kaw/ ‘greedy’ + linker na/-mg > matakaw na /mata:kaw naj

as in:
masipag diligent
magalang na tao ‘a courteous person’
matakaw greedy

(The /na/ form of the linker na/-ng also occurs after a pausc, whatever may be the final consonant of the
word that precedes the pause — cf. §3.18.) (Some speakers occasionally, and others regularly, omit the /na/
form of the linker na/-ng immediately after one of the enclitic particles daw, lafmang, and tuloy — cf.
§ §6.4 and 6.5. Thus the following sentence is acceptable with or without na:

Masipag daw (na) tao ang kailangan nila.
‘They say that what they necd is a diligent person.")

English has no device used in modification constructions that corresponds very closely to the Tagalog
linker na-/-ng. The most important grammatical device for expressing modification in English is word
order: one-word modifiers usually precede, and phrasal modifiers usually follow, the head: ‘new book’
versus ‘book on the table’. In Tagalog modification constructions, on the other hand, word order is
relatively free. Thus ‘new book’ may be either bagong libro or librong bago, and ‘book on the table’ either
nasa mesang libro or librong nasa mesa. Certain Tagalog modification constructions, however, do show
word-order restrictions or word-order preferences. These restrictions and preferences are dealt with in the
appropriate sections on the following page.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 119

The modification constructions that have been used by way of example thus far have all been of quite
simple structure, with the modifier corresponding to the predicate of a basic sentence, and the head to the
topic of a basic sentence; such constructions may be called SIMPLE MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONS.
Both the modifier and the head may, however, be of more complex structure. Consider, for example, the
sentence:

Nobela ang librong nasa mesang mababa.
‘The book on the low table is a novel.’

Librong nasa mesang mababa ‘book on the low table’ is a modification construction, consisting of the head
libro, a linker, and the modifier nasa mesang mababa. But the latter itself includes a modification
construction, mesang mababa ‘low table’, which consists of the head mesa, a linker, and the modifier
mababa. Similarly, the head of a modification construction may itself include a modification construction:

Nobela ang bagong librong nasa mesa.
‘The new book on the table is a novel.”

Here, bagong libro ‘new book’, which is the head of bagong librong nasa mesa, includes the modifier bago
and the head fibro. Modification constructions like these, in which the head and/or the modifier includes a
modification construction, may be called COMPLEX MODIFICATION CONSTRUCTIONS.

In the sections that follow, simple modification constructions are dealt with first. Since the head of a
simple modification construction is, by definition, a noun or a pronoun (corresponding to the topic of a
basic sentence), the various simple constructions may be classified and discussed on the basis of the kinds of
modifiers involved. Simple modification constructions headed by personal pronouns and personal nouns,
however, have certain peculiarities that warrant separate discussion. In the sections that follow, the simple
modification constructions of Tagalog are presented in the following order: noun head with noun modifier
in §3.12; noun head with one-word-adjective modifier in §3.13; noun head with phrase modifier in §3.14;
modification of personal pronouns in §3.15; modification of personal nouns in §3.16. (For examples of
modification constructions with nominalized adjectivals and verbals as heads, cf. §3.24.) Complex
modification constructions are presented in §3.17.

Like English, Tagalog distinguishes between modification constructions involving RESTRICTIVE
modifiers and those involving NONRESTRICTIVE modifiers. A restrictive modifier is one that limits the
reference of the head with which it occurs. A nonrestrictive modifier is one that merely gives information
about the head. Some English examples may clarify the distinction. Compare:

a. ‘The students who worked hard passed.’
b. ‘The students, who worked hard, passed.”

Both sentences contain modification constructions whose head is ‘students’ and whose modifier is ‘who
worked hard’. The modifier in sentence a is restrictive, and limits the reference of the head. Thus the
sentence does not say that the students as a group passed, but rather that those students with the quality
expressed by the restrictive modifier — namely, those who worked hard — passed. The modifier in sentence
b on the other hand, is nonrestrictive and merely gives information about the head. Thus sentence b says
that the students as a group passed, and gives some information about the students: namely, that they
worked hard.

Most of the Tagalog modification constructions to be dealt with in §§3.12 through 3.17 involve

restrictive modifiers. Modification constructions involving nonsestrictive modifiers have, as a group, certain
distinctive formal characteristics that warrant separate treatment, and are dealt with in §3.18.

Finally, §§3.19 and 3.20 deal with the two classes of modification constructions that either do not
involve the device of linking at all or do not involve the device in all cases: modification constructions with
adverbial modifiers ($3.19) and possessive modification constructions (§3.20).

§3.12. Modification constructions: noun head with noun modifier.
In this and the following two sections, NOUN is used as a cover term for unmarked nouns and deictic

pronouns. (Note that the term noun, as used in these sections, does not include personal pronouns or
personal nouns.)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
120 CHAPTER 3

Any equational sentence with a noun predicate and a noun topic may serve as the constituent
sentence of a modification construction of the shape noun + linker (na/-ng) + noun. Thus corresponding to
sentences such as Repolyo ang gulay ‘The vegetable (dish) is (made from) cabbage’ and Besbol ang laro ‘The
game is baseball’, there are modification constructions such as gulay na repolyo ‘vegetable dish made from
cabbage’ and darong besbol “baseball game’.

The preferred ordering of nouns within a simple modification construction is: head-linker-modifier.
That is, the first noun of the construction generally corresponds to the noun in topic position in the
constituent sentence, the second to the noun in predicate position. In most cases, therefore, the first noun
represents older information or a more general semantic category, while the second noun represents newer,
more explicit, or contrastive information. Thus, to convey in a modification construction the relation
expressed in the sentence Kalan ang lanuan ‘The toy is a stove’, the order laruan-linker-kalan (lantang kalan
‘toy stove’) is preferred. Only when there is a wish to contrast ‘toy stove’ with, for example, ‘real stove’, is
the order Kalan-linker-laruan (kalang laruan ‘toy stove’ or ‘stove that’s a toy’) preferred; and here the
underlying sentence would be Laruan ang kalan ‘The stove is a toy’.

The modifying and/or contrastive function of the second noun in a modification construction is also
evident when one of the nouns is a deictic. In a sentence like Mahal ang damnit na ito ‘This dress is
expensive’, the deictic ito is a modifier that makes the referent of the noun damit explicit. Expressed in
terms of matrix, constituent, and resultant sentences, the relationships within Mahal ang damit na ito are as
follows:

Matrix sentence: Mahal ang damit.

‘The dress is expensive.”

———SSEee———

Constituent sentence: Ito ang damit.

‘This is the dress.’
Resultant sentence: Mahal ang damit na ito.

‘This dress is expensive.’

A possible context for the resultant sentence is:

Mahal ang damit na ito. Pero mura ang damit na iyan.

“This dress is expensive. But that dress is cheap.

On the other hand, putting a deictic before, rather than after, the linker, as in itong damnit ‘this dress’ results
in giving the noun that follows the linker a contrastive, and hence modifying function:

Matrix sentence: Mahal ito.
‘This is expensive.’

Constituent sentence: Damit ito.
‘This isa dress.’

Resultant sentence: Mahal itong damit.
‘This dress is expensive.’

A possible context for this resultant sentence is:

Mahal itong damit. Pero mura itong sombrero.
‘This dress is expensive. But this Aar is cheap.”

If the plural marker mga — cf. §3.9 — occurs in a modification construction involving a deictic and

another noun, it precedes the other noun in all cases: thus, itong mga damit ‘these dresses; mga damit na
ito “these dresses’.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 121

A deictic sa pronoun — dito, ctc. — cannot serve as the head of a regular modification construction.
Thus, there is no *Para ditong damit ang mga bitones derivable from Para dito ang mga bitones ‘The
buttons are for this’ and Damit ito ‘This is a dress’. To express the equivalent of, e.g., ‘for this dress’,
Tagalog docs not use a modification construction, but uses instead a special construction in which a deictic
sa pronoun is immediately followed by another sa phrase, without linking: Para dito sa damit ang mga
bitones ‘The buttons are for this dress’. Other examples are:

Ibigay mo riyan sa bata ang libro.
‘Give the book to that child.”

Pumunta ka roon sa palengke.
‘Go to that market.

§3.13. Modification constructions: noun head with adjective modifier.

There is a group of adjectives which, in simple modification constructions headed by an unmarked
noun, regularly precede the linker. These adjectives include the CARDINAL and ORDINAL NUMBERS (cf,
§4.4) and a small list of other words, called LIMITERS (cf. §3.22), that express quantity or order in a
series: e.g., marami ‘much, many’, huli ‘(the) last’. Thus, corresponding to the sentences:

Dalawa
Marami
ang bata.
Ikalawa
Huli

‘There are two children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are two.’)
‘There are many children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are many.’)
‘The child is second.”

‘The child is last.’

are the following modification constructions:

dalawang “wo children’

maraming ‘many children’
bata

ikalawang “the second child’

huling ‘the last child’

(In modification constructions consisting of a deictic and a number or limiter, word order is determined by
which of the two elements is the head, as in the case of the deictic-plus-unmarked-noun modification
constructions discussed in §3.12. Thus itong dalawa is ‘these two’, with head ito and modifier dalawa,
while (ag) dalawang ito is ‘these two’, with the nominalized head dalawa and the modifier ito.)

Word order is much less fixed in simple modification constructions that involve modifying adjectives
other than numbers or limiters. In the case of such constructions, decided word-order preferences obtain

only when the construction occurs as an unmarked predicate. In this position, if the adjective and the noun
provide equally new or equally important information, the order noun-linker-adjective is preferred: e.g.,

Doktor na bantog ang ama ni Juan.
‘Juan's father is a famous doctor.”

The order doktor na bantog ‘famous doctor’ suggests that the audience knows neither that Juan’s father is a
doctor nor that he is a famous one.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
122 CHAPTER 3

If, however, the information provided by the noun is relatively well-known or self-evident, while the
information provided by the adjective is less well known or less self-evident, the order adjective-linker-noun
is preferred: ¢.g.,

Bantog na tao ang ama ni Juan.
‘Juan’s father is a famous man.”

Bantog na siyudad ang Maynila.
‘Manila is a famous city.”

Here, the tao in the first sentence and the siyudad in the second provide relatively little information, since
the audience may be assumed to know that Juan's father is a ‘man’ and Manila a ‘city’. Hence the order
taong bantog or siyudad na bantog would be felt to place unnecessary emphasis upon the obvious.
Similarly, the first example above, Doktor na bantog ang ama ni Juan, would not normally be used in a
situation in which the audience already knew that Juan's father was a doctor. In this situation Bantog na
doktor ang ama ni Juan would be preferred.

In other than unmarked-predicate position — e.g., after ang, ng, or sa — the order of the modifying
adjective and the head noun is not significant. Either the adjective-linker-noun order or the

noun-linker-adjective order may be used, without any apparent difference in meaning.
Some examples are:

bantog na siyudad
Ang

ang siyudad na ito.
siyudad na bantog
‘This city is the famous city.”

pulang baro.
Magara ang
barong pula.
‘The red dress is attractive.”
fen tao. !
Siya ang anak ng
taong mayaman.
‘He’s the son of a rich man.”
maliit na bahay.
Bumili sila ng
bahay na maliit.
‘They bought a small house.’
malaking bintana
Para sa ang kurtina.
bintanang malaki

‘The curtain is for the big window.”

magagandang babae.
Humahanga siya sa

babaeng magaganda.
‘He admires beautiful women.’

In such constructions, when one order results in the use of the /-n/ form of the linker and the other in
the use of the /na/ form of the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11), the former is slightly preferred. Thus bagong titser
‘new teacher’ would be somewhat more likely to occur than fitser na bago, and batang mabait ‘good child’
than mabait na bata.

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 123

§3.14. Modification constructions: noun head with modifying phrase.*

Any adjective phrase or verbal that occurs as predicate with a given noun in topic position may occur
as modifier with that same noun as head. The shape of the phrase in the modification construction is
exactly the same as its shape as predicate of the constituent sentence (cf. §3.11): thus from the
constituent sentence Nagbabasa ng diyaryo ang babae ‘The woman is reading a paper’ is derived the
modification construction babaeng nagbabasa ng diyaryo ‘woman reading a paper’ (as in Ang babaeng
nagbabasa ng diyarvo ang tiya ko ‘The woman reading a paper is my aunt’) in which the predicate of the
constituent sentence, nagbabasa ng diyaryo, appears intact. In this respect Tagalog modifying phrases differ
from English modifying phrases, which, even when they are derived from the predicate of the constituent
sentence, are somewhat different in shape from the predicate itself. Thus from the constituent sentence
‘The woman is reading a paper’ English derives such modification constructions as ‘woman who is reading a
paper’ and ‘woman reading a paper’ (e.g., ‘The woman (who is) reading a paper is my aunt’), but not
‘woman is reading a paper’ (“The woman is reading a paper is my aunt’).

Another respect in which Tagalog modification constructions involving modifying phrases differ from
their English counterparts is word order. As was mentioned in §3.11, English modifying phrases normally
follow the head: e.g., ‘woman reading a paper’, ‘book on the table’. Tagalog modifying phrases, on the
other hand, may in most cases either precede or follow the head. Thus:

nagbabasa ng diyaryong babae
‘woman reading a paper’
babaeng nagbabasa ng diyaryo

nasa mesang libro
‘book on the table’

librong nasa mesa

There is, however, a tendency to prefer the order head-linker-modifier when the modifying phrase is long.
Thus, while teacher who gave her students books’ may be either titser na nagbigay ng libro sa Kaniyang mga
istudyante or nagbigay ng libro sa kaniyang mga istudyanteng titser, the former is preferred. There is also a
preference for the order head-linker-modifier when, as is often the case, the order modifier-linker-head is
potentially ambiguous. The sentence

Amerikanong may pera si Bob.
‘Bob is an American with money.’

is, for example, unambiguous, but
May perang Amerikano si Bob.

may mean cither the same as the first sentence or ‘Bob has American moncy.” The first sentence, which
avoids ambiguity, is preferred.
Some further examples of sentences that include modifying phrases are:

kotseng gusto ni Juan?
Alin ang

gusto ni Juang kotse?
‘Which is the car Juan likes?”

kuwentong tungkol sa giyera.
Ayaw niya ng mga

tungkol sa giycrang kuwento.
*He doesn’t like stories about war.”

 

*The term phrase, as used in this section, includes all structures classified as adjective phrases in Chapter 4 or as verbals in
Chapter 5, although some of these structures actually consist of a single word.

Regalong para sa titser

Para sa titser na regalo
‘This is a present for the teacher,”

librong nasa mesa.
Nobela ang

nasa mesang libro.
‘The book on the table is a novel.”

An abbreviated alternative to a head-linker-modifier construction may occur whenever the modifier is
a reservational, partisanship or purpose phrase of the shape para + sa + noun (cf. §4.20) or a locative phrase
of the shape na + sa + noun (cf. §4.19). In the case of a para-sa-phrase modifier, the abbreviation consists in
the deletion of the linker, so that the resultant constructions has the shape: head + para + sa + noun. If, for
example, the linker is deleted from regalong para sa titser ‘present for the teacher’, what remains is regalo
para sa titser, which has exactly the same meaning. In the case of a locative-phrase modifier, the
abbreviation consists in the deletion of both the linker and the na of the locative phrase, so that the
resultant construction has the shape: head + sa + noun. If, for example, the linker and the na are deleted
from librong nasa mesa ‘book on the table’, what remains is libro sa mesa which has exactly the same
meaning. Some further examples of abbreviated para-sa-phrasc-modifier and locative-modifier constructions
are given below. In each case the full form of the construction, which includes the linker (and, in the case
of locative modifiers, the na of the locative phrase), is given above the abbreviated form:

titser na para sa ikalawang met

Sino ang
titser para sa ikalawang grado?
‘Who is the teacher for the second grade?’

telegramang para sa iyo.
May

telegrama para sa iyo.
‘There’s a telegram for you.’

bahay na nasa |

Malaki ang
bahay sa kanto.

‘The house on the corner is big.’

silya sa salas.
‘He took the chair (that was) in the living room.’

silyang nasa salas.
Kinuha niya ang

(The last of the above examples is actually ambiguous in its abbreviated form, since sa salas may be
interpreted not only as a locative modifier of silya, but also as a locative adverb placed in sentence-final

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 125

position — cf. §6.9. With the latter interpretation, the sentence Kinuha niya ang silya sa salas would have
the meaning ‘He took the chair from the living room’, This type of ambiguity is quite common when the
abbreviated locative-modifier construction is used.)

§3.15. Modification of personal pronouns.

Modification constructions headed by personal pronouns are considerably more restricted, both in
their internal structure and in the contexts in which they occur, than are modification constructions headed
by nouns. The order of elements within a modification construction headed by a personal pronoun is
always head (pronoun) + linker + modifier. Thus:

mga sundalo soldiers’

tatlo three”

mga pagod tired ones’
kaming “we

mahihirap poor ones’

nasa hukbo in the army’

pinili niya whom he chose’

but not: “nga sundalong kami, etc.
In the case of singular pronouns, only the ang forms (cf. §3.3) may occur as heads of modification
constructions, and then only in predicate position. Thus:

Ikaw na Pilipino ang kailangan ng heneral.
‘What the general needs is you, a Filipino.”

but not:

*Kailangan kang Pilipino ng heneral.
These restrictions do not apply to plural pronouns. Ang, ng, and sa plural pronouns may all head
modification constructions, and such modification constructions may occur in all the same contexts as the
unmodified pronouns. Thus:

Kailangan kayong mga Pilipino ng heneral.
‘The general need you Filipinos.’

Mahal ninyong mga Pilipino ang bayan ninyo.
‘Your country is dear to you Filipinos.’

Para sa inyong mga Pilipino ang paanyayang ito.
‘This invitation is for your Filipinos.”

For some speakess, any noun or pluralizable one-word adjective modifying a plural pronoun must be
explicitly pluralized (cf. §§3.9 and 4.11). For other speakers explicit pluralization in such cases is not
obligatory, but merely preferred. There is thus a certain amount of disagreement about the acceptability of
constructions such as Kayong Pilipino and kaming mahirap. All speakers prefer Kayong mga Pilipino and
kKaming (mga) mahihirap, and some reject the constructions with nonpluralized modifiers altogether.

Modification constructions headed by the mg ang sa third-person-plural pronouns nila and Kanila are
relatively rare except where the modifier is a cardinal number. Thus constructions like nilang/kanilang mga
Pilipino ‘(of/to) them who are Filipinos’ are uncommon, but constructions like nilang/kanilang dalawa
‘(of/to) the two of them’ are of frequent occurrence.

In many cases, sentences that may be interpreted as involving modification constructions headed by
ng Or sa pronouns are susceptible to another structural interpretation as well. Thus the sentence:

Ilan ang pipiliin naming mga opisyal?

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
126 CHAPTER 3 -

may mean either ‘How many will we officers choose?’ (in which case naming mga opisyal is a
pronoun-headed modification construction) or ‘How many officers will we choose?’ (in which case pipiliin
naming mga opisyal is a modification construction headed by mga opisyal: literally, ‘(the)
will-be-chosen-by-us officers’). Similarly the sentence:

Para sa inyong mga ina ang paanyayang ito.

may mean either ‘This invitation is for you mothers’ (in which case inyong mga ina is a pronoun-headed
modification construction) or ‘This invitation is for your mothers (in which case inyong mga ina is a
possessive modification construction — cf. §3.19). In most such cases of ambiguity, native speakers of
Tagalog tend to interpret the sentences as not involving pronoun-headed modification constructions unless
the context makes this interpretation perfectly clear.

§3.16. Modification of personal nouns.

A personal noun may serve as either the first or the second component of a simple modification
construction, and may or may not be preceded by a personal-noun marker,

(a) Personal noun as first component; personal-noun marker. A pessonal noun that is the first
component of a modification construction is always the head of the construction. If the personal noun is
preceded by a personal-noun marker (si, ni, kay), the construction has the meaning of naming and
characterizing an individual. The characterization is expressed by the modifier. If this modifier is an
adjectival or a verbal, it acts as an epithet, serving, in effect, as part of the name: e.g.,

marunong.”
lyon si pedrong
gumagawa ng sapatos.’

wise.”
‘That’s Pedro the
maker of shoes.”

In order for an adjectival or a verbal to occur in this construction, it must express a potentially
characteristic quality or activity. Certain kinds of adjectivals and verbals are thus disqualified from
occurring in the construction. In particular, it may be noted that a verbal modifier must be in the
imperfective aspect, the aspect used to express habitual activity (cf. §2.7). While, for example, a verbal like
gumagawa ng sapatos ‘makes shoes’ may occur as a modifier after si Pedrong, a verbal like gumawa ng
sapatos ‘made shoes’ or gagawa ng sapatos ‘will make shoes’ may not.

A modifying unmarked noun in this construction may or may not serve as an epithet. Thus si Pedrong
mangingisda may mean either ‘Pedro the fisherman’, with mangingisda ‘fisherman’ functioning as part of
the name, or ‘Pedro, the fisherman’, with mangingisda functioning as a charactesizing modifier but not part
of the name. (When the unmarked noun does not function as an epithet, an alternative construction may
occur. This construction, which may be called an APPOSITIONAL CONSTRUCTION, involves, instead of
the linker na/-ng, a pause and the marker ang before the unmarked noun. Thus:

si Pedro, ang mangingisda
‘Pedro, the fisherman’
si Pedrong mangingisda

The appositional construction is a standard alternative to the modification construction only when the
marker that precedes the personal noun is si. However, constructions like ni Pedro, ang mangingisda and
kay Pedro, ang mangingisda — as alternatives to ni Pedrong mangingisda and kay Pedrong mangingisda
respectively — though rare, are probably grammatical.)

For reasons similar to those that disqualify certain adjectivals and verbals from occurrence in this
construction, deictic pronouns may not occur. There is, for example, no *si Pedrong ito, since ito ‘this’
cannot serve as a characterization.

(b) Personal noun as first component; no personal-noun marker. If a personal noun occurring as the
first component of a modification construction is not preceded by a personal-noun marker (but is preceded,
instead, by ang, ng, or sa), the construction has the meaning of distinguishing a particular person from
another or others with the same name. The construction is, in other words, contrastive, either explicitly or
implicitly: e.g.,

marunong
inihalal nila

Hinahanap ko ang Pedrong (hindi ang Pedrong...)
mangingisda
ito

the Pedro who's wise
the Pedro they elected

‘I'm looking for the Pedro who’s a fisherman (not the Pedro... )’
this Pedro

(c) Personal noun as second component; personal-noun marker. As the second component of a
modification construction, a personal noun may be preceded by only one of the personal-noun
maskers: the marker si. The first element of the construction may be preceded by ang, ng, or sa, and it is
this marker, rather than the si before the personal noun that indicates the function in the sentence of the
modification construction as a whole. Thus:

lyon ang mabait na si Mr. Cruz.
‘That's kind Mr. Cruz.”

Pinili ka ng mabait na si Mr. Cruz.
‘Kind Mr. Cruz chose you.’

Dadalaw ako sa mabait na si Mr. Cruz.
‘I'm going to visit kind Mr. Cruz.”

If the first element of the construction is an adjectival or a verbal, the personal noun is the head of
the construction:

mabait na
lyon ang si Mr. Cruz.
inihalal naming

kind Mr, Cruz.”
‘That’s
Mr. Cruz, whom we elected.’

If the first element of the construction is a nominal, the personal noun serves as a modifier:

lyon ang senador na si Mr. Cruz.
‘That’s the senator (named) Mr. Cruz.”

In all cases, the construction has the meaning of naming and giving information about an individual.

(d) Personal noun as second component: no personal-noun marker. When a personal noun occurring
as the second component of a modification construction is not preceded by a personal-noun marker, the
first element of the construction is normally an adjectival or a verbal. In these cases, the personal noun is
the head of the construction, and the construction, which is contrastive in meaning, is interchangeable with
the contrastic construction discussed above, in which the personal noun is the first component. Thus:
128 CHAPTER 3

Pedrong marunong.
Hinahanap ko ang

marunong na Pedro.
‘I'm looking for the Pedro who's wise.”

Pedrong inihalal nila.
Hinahanap ko ang

inihalal nilang Pedro.
‘I'm looking for the Pedro they elected.”

An unmarked noun cannot occur as the first component of this construction. Thus there is no *ang
mangingisdang Pedro to correspond to ang Pedrong mangingisda ‘the Pedro who's a fisherman’. If a deictic
pronoun occurs as the first component of the construction, the deictic is the head of the construction and
the construction is not contrastive. Rather, it has the meaning ‘this/that (one named) ’, Like the
ang-plus-personal-noun construction mentioned in §3.5, this construction is of limited distribution,
occusring regularly only in predicate position: e.g.,

lyong Juan daw ang kapatid niya.
‘They say that his brother is that (person named) Juan.’

Itong Maria ang nakayayamot.
‘The trouble-maker is this (person named) Maria.’

§3.17. Complex modification constructions.

A complex modification construction is a modification construction whose head and/or modifier
itself includes a modification construction. A head that includes a modification construction is a
COMPLEX HEAD; a modifier that includes a modification construction is a COMPLEX MODIFIER.

A complex head, like the simple heads dealt with in § §3.12 through 3.16, always corresponds to the
topic of a constituent sentence; a complex modificr, like the simple modifiers, always corresponds to the
predicate of a constituent sentence. The complex modification construction maliit na laruan kalan ‘small
toy stove’, for example, includes the complex head laruang kalan ‘toy stove’, which corresponds to the
topic of the constituent sentence:

Maliit ang laruang kalan
‘The toy stove is small.”

The complex modification construction gulay na repolyong gisado ‘vegetable dish (made from) sauteed
cabbage’, includes the complex modifier repolyong gisado ‘sauteed cabbage’, which corresponds to the
predicate of the constituent sentence:

Repolyong gisado ang gulay.
‘The vegetable dish is (made from) sauteed cabbage.’

(It is often the case that a complex modification construction is ambiguous because it corresponds to
two different constituent sentences. Consider, for example, the complex modification construction
istudyanteng mahusay na Kantor. This construction may mean either ‘good student who is a singer’ or
‘student who is a good singer’. In the first interpretation, the construction includes a complex head,
istudyanteng mahusay ‘good student’, and a simple modifier, Kantor ‘singer’, and corresponds to the
constituent sentence:

Kantor ang istudyanteng mahusay.
‘The good student is a singer.”

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 129

In the second interpretation, the construction includes a simple head, istudyante ‘student’, and a complex
modifier, miahusay na Kantor ‘good singer’, and corresponds to the constituent sentence:

Mahusay na kantor ang istudyante.
‘The student is a good singer.’)

The order of two elements within a complex head or modifier is normally in accord with the
generalizations about word order in modification constructions made in § §3.12 through 3.16. Thus the
generalization that governs the preference for laruang kalan over kalang laruan for expressing ‘toy stove’ (cf.
§3.12) applies to the expression of ‘toy stove’ as a complex head — c.g., maliit na laruang Kalan ‘small toy
stove’ — or as a complex modifier — c.g., regalong lanuang kalan ‘gift (of a) toy stove’.

The complex modification constructions presented by way of example thus far have all consisted of
three linked elements, analyzable either into complex head and simple modifier or simple head and
complex modifier. Complex constructions that include four or more linked elements are, however, by no
means uncommon. Both the head and the modifier may be complex: e.g.,

maliit na regalong laruang kalan
‘small gift (of a) toy stove,"

which is analyzable into the complex head, maliit na regalo, and the complex modifier, faruang kalan. And
either or both the head and modifier may include more than two linked elements: ¢.g.,

maljit na regalong laruang kalan
‘this small gift (of a) plastic toy stove,’

which is analyzable into the three-element complex head maliit na regalong ito and the three-element
complex modifier kalang laruang plastic.

A deictic at the beginning of a complex modification construction is normally the head (or part of
the complex head) of the construction. For example:

itong hinog na mangga ‘this ripe mango”

In the example, hinog na mangga makes explicit the referent of ito, as in the examples of deictic heads
presented in §3.12. Thus itong hinog na mangga suggests some such context as ‘this ripe mango, not this
green papaya’, and contrasts with hinog na manggang ito, which suggests ‘this ripe mango, not that one’.

A deictic may occur at the beginning of a complex modification construction that includes a deictic
modifier. (The initial and noninital deictics in such constructions are always the same.) For example:

itong manggang ito ‘this mango’
iyang damit na iyan ‘that dress’
iyong lapis na iyon “that pencil’

In such cases, the initial deictic is not the head of the construction, but serves, rather, as an intensifier of
the deictic modifier. Thus itong manggang ito, like manggang ito, suggests a context like ‘this mango, not
that one’, rather than a context like ‘this mango, not this papaya’.

A number or other limiter (cf. §§3.13, 3.22, and 4.4), may occur as part of a complex head or
complex modifier, and is normally the first element within the complex unit: e.g.,

tatlong kahong kahoy ‘three wooden boxes’
regalong dalawang mangga “gift (of) two mangoes’

In the first of the above examples, fatio ‘three’ may be either part of the complex head tatlong kahon ‘three

boxes’ or a modifier of the complex head kahong kahoy ‘wooden boxes.’ (The corresponding constituent
sentences are:

Elements sous droits d'auteur
130 CHAPTER 3

Kahoy ang tatlong kahon.
‘The three boxes are wooden.”

Tatlo ang kahong kahoy.
‘The wooden boxes are three.” (‘There are three wooden boxes.")

It is this structural ambiguity that accounts for the fact that the construction might be used in cither of the
following contexts:

tatlong kahong kahoy — hindi papel
‘three wooden boxes — not paper’

tatlong kahong kahoy — hindi dalawa
‘three wooden boxes — not fwo’

In regalong dalawang mangga, dalawa ‘two* is part of the complex modifier dalawang mangga ‘two

mangocs’,
A modification construction consisting of a number or limiter, the linker #a-/-ng, and a noun that
expresses a unit of measurement or a containing unit may be used as a complex modifier: ¢.g.,

isang librang mantikilya ‘one/a pound of butter’
dalawang sakong bigas “two bags of rice*
maraming tasang kape ‘many cups of coffee*

(When a number/limiter + linker + noun-of-measurement construction is used to express a measured
selection from a specific source, the construction is followed by the marker ng instead of the linker na/-ng.
Thus ‘a pound of the butter’ is isang libra ng mantikilya, ‘two bags of that rice’ is dalawang sako ng bigas na
iyan. This construction is similar to the limiter-plus-ng-phrase construction discussed in §3.22.)

A verb or adjective phrase may occur in a complex modification construction, functioning as a

modifier, part of a complex modifier, or part of a complex head: e.g.,

binili kong
damit na seda
para sa batang
I bought’
‘silk dress
for the child’
pinitas niya kahapon
regalong manggang
galing sa probinsiya
he picked yesterday"
“gift (of) mangoes
from the provinces’
nilabhan ko kahapong
damit na lana
para kay Mariang

for Maria’

I washed yesterday”
‘wool dress

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 131 —

And a modifying verb or adjective phrase may inchide within it a modification construction: eg..

binili ng bagong titser
librong

nasa mesang mababa

the new teacher bought’
‘book

on the low table*

(The modifying verb phrase binili ng bagong titser includes the modification construction bagong titser
‘new teacher’; the modifying adjective phrase nasa mesang mababa includes the modification construction
mesang mababa ‘low table’.) The presence of a modification construction within a modifying phrase has no
influence upon the order of the phrase in relation to its head.

§3.18. Nonrestrictive modifiers.

As was noted in §3.11, Tagalog, like English, makes a distinction between restrictive and
nonrestrictive modifiers: i.e., between modifiers that limit the reference of the head with which they occur
and those that merely give information about the head. Most of the modification constructions described
and illustrated in the preceding sections involve restrictive modifiers. Exceptions are certain of the
modification constructions dealt with in §§3.15 and 3.16, headed by personal pronouns and personal
nouns, The modifiers in these constructions — e.g., Pilipino in ikaw na Pilipino ‘you, a Filipino’, inihalal nila
in ang inihalal nilang si Mr. Cruz ‘Mr. Cruz, whom they elected’ — are necessarily nonrestrictive because the
heads with which they occur have in themselves a limited reference that does not allow of further limitation
by modifiers of these types. The present section is not concerned with nonrestrictive modifiers of this kind,
which are nonrestrictive by virtue of the meaning of the heads with which they occur, but are otherwise
indistinguishable from restrictive modifiers. Rather, it is concerned with those nonrestrictive modifiers that
have distinctive formal characteristics.

In English, the distinction between a restrictive and a nonrestrictive modifier is normally signaled by
intonation. Nonrestrictive modifiers are spoken as separate intonation phrases, and are bounded by pauses
(indicated by commas in writing), while restrictive modifiers usually follow their head without pause and
form a single intonation phrase with it. Thus:

‘the students, who worked hard...’ (nonrestrictive; two intonation phrases)
vs. ‘the students who worked hard...” (restrictive; one intonation phrase).

In Tagalog too, nonrestrictive modifiers constitute separate intonation phrases while restrictive modifiers
normally do not:

ang mga mag-aaral, na nagtrabaho nang masikap,... (two phrases)
‘the students, who worked hard...’

Vs. ang mga mag-aaral na nagtrabaho nang masikap... (one phrase)
‘the students who worked hard..."

Another similarity between English and Tagalog nonrestrictive modifiers is that, in both languages,
such modifiers always follow their heads. Thus the reversibility of head and modifier that has been ascribed,
in preceding sections, to Tagalog modification constructions as a group does not apply in cases when the
modifier is nonrestrictive. In all cases of nonrestrictive modification, the head is the first element of the
construction, the modifier the second.

The fact that a nonrestrictive modifier always constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is
consequently preceded by a pause, has consequences for the shape of the linker ma-/-ng in nonrestrictive

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

132 CHAPTER 3

modification. As was noted in §3.11, only the /na/ form of the linker occurs after a pause, whatever may
be the final consonant of the independent form of the pre-pausal word. Therefore, in cases where the /n/
form of the linker occurs before a restrictive modifier (i.¢., cases where the preceding word ends, in its
independent form, in /hj, /*/, or /n/), there is, in addition to the pause, a second formal distinction between
modification constructions involving nonrestrictive modifiers and those involving restrictive
modifiers: namely, the distinction between the /na/ and the /n/ forms of the linker. Thus:

ang mga ¢studyante, na nagtrabaho nang masikap
‘the students, who worked hard*

vs. ang mga estudyanteng nagtrabaho nang masikap
‘the students who worked hard”

There are certain types of structures that may serve freely as restrictive modifiers but that either do
not occur or occur rarcly as nonrestrictive modifiers. Unmarked nouns, for example, do not occur as
nonrestrictive modifiers unless they themselves are modified. Thus, while there are restrictive constructions
like ang guro kong Amerikana ‘my American teacher’ or ‘my teacher who is an American’, there are no
constructions like “ang guro ko, na Amerikana. (To express the equivalent of ‘my teacher, who is an
American’, Tagalog requires the use of isa ‘one/a(n)’ plus linker within the nonrestrictive modifier: ang
guro ko, na isang Amerikana.) :

One-word adjectives occur rarcly if at all as nonrestrictive modifiers, except when the adjectives are
intensified. (Cf. §4.12 for the intensification of adjectives.) While constructions like ang guro ko, na
napakahusay or ang guro ko, na mahusay na mahusay ‘my teacher, who is very good’ are quite acceptable
(napakahusay and mahusay na mahusay are both intensifications of mahusay ‘good’), constructions like ang
guro ko, na mahusay are of questionable grammaticalness.

§3.19. Adverbial modifiers.
Two types of adverbs occur as modifiers in nominal modification constructions: time adverbs and
locative adverbs. These are the same two classes of adverbs that may occur in sentence-initial position as

pseudo-predicates (cf. §§6.8 and 6.9). The head nouns with which time and locative adverbs may occur as
modifiers are the same nouns that may occur as topics with adverbial pseudo-psedicates: i.e., nouns that
express events. Some examples of time and locative adverbs used as pseudo-predicates are:

Alas nuwebe
ang handaan.
Sa bahay ko
at nine o'clock.”
‘The party is/was
at my house.”
Tuwing Linggo
ang mga miting.
Sa likod ng simbahan
every Sunday.”
‘The meetings are held
behind the church.’
Noong isang buwan
ang aksidente.
Dito

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEJR EXPANSIONS 133

last month.”
‘The accident hanpened
here.’

Modification constructions involving adverbial modifiers differ from modification constructions
involving modifiers of other types in two respects. One of these is that the adverbial modifier is not linked
to the head of the modification constructions by the linker na/-ng. Instead, the head and the modifier are
merely juxtaposed, without any intervening linker. Thus:

nang alas nuwebe
handaan

sa bahay ko

at nine o’clock”
“party

at my house’

(cf. handaang ganito kasaya
‘party as pleasant as this’)

(The nang that introduces certain time adverbs when they are non-sentence-initial, but which is lost when
the adverbs occur sentence-initially, is always retained when these adverbs are used as modifiers — cf. §6.8.
Thus: handaan nang alas nuwebe, rather than *handaan a las nuwebe ~— cf. Gagawin ang handaan nang alas
nuwebe/Alas nuwebe 'y gagawin ang handaan ‘The party will be given at nine o’clock’.)

(A construction consisting of a noun head and a locative—adverb modifier is similar in form to the
abbreviated construction mentioned in §3.14, in which the linker na/-ng and the na- of a modifying
locative—adjective phrase are deleted. An example of the latter construction is silid sa bahay ko ‘room in
my house’, which is similar in form to handaan sa bahay ko ‘party at my house’. It should be noted,
however, that the two constructions differ in one important respect: there is always a longer construction
that corresponds to the abbreviated construction, but there is no longer construction that corresponds to
the construction with a locative-adverb modifier. Thus corresponding (o silid sa bahay ko is silid na nasa
bahay ko ‘room in my house’. But there is no *handaang nasa bahay ko corresponding to handaan sa bahay
ko.)

The second respect in which modification constructions involving adverbs differ from other
modification constructions is that an adverbial modifier always follows the head, while modifiers, of most
other types may either precede or follow the head. Thus, there are no such constructions as:

*(ng) alas nuwebe(ng)
handaan

*sa bahay ko(ng)

(cf. ganito kasayang handaan
‘party as pleasant as this’)

Some examples of sentences involving modification constructions with adverbial modifiers are:

nang alas nuwebe.
Malaking kasayahan ang handaan
sa bahay ko.
at nine o'clock
‘The party is/was a big affair.”
at my house

Elements sous droits d'auteur
134 CHAPTER 3

tuwing Linggo
Tungkol sa mga miting ang aming usapan.
sa likod ng simbahan

every Sunday.”
‘Our conversation was about the meetings (held)
behind the church.”

noong isang buwan?
Sino ang makakalimot ng aksidente
dito?

last month?’
‘Who can forget the accident (that happened)
here?”

(Some sentences that involve adverbial modifiers are ambiguous, since the phrases may be interpretable as
referring to the entire predicate-plus-topic structure, as well as to the nominal head alone. Thus the
sentence Pinag-usapan namin ang aksidente noong isang buwan may mean either ‘We talked about the
accident (that happened) last month’, in which case noong isang buwan is interpreted as a modifier of
aksidente, or ‘Last month we talked about the accident’, in which case noong isang buwan is interpreted as
referring to the entire predicate-plus-topic structure.)

When an adverb occurs in a complex modification construction (cf. §3.18), it is always the last
element of the construction. Regardless of whether the clement that precedes the adverb is the head of the
construction or another modifier, the adverb is never preceded by a linker. Thus:

handaang malaki

nang alas nuwebe
malaking handaan
‘big party at nine o'clock’

§3.20. Possessive modification constructions.

Tagalog has two classes of possessive constructions: possessive sentences, and possessive modification
constructions. Every possessive construction, whether a sentence or a modification construction, includes as
its basic components a word or phrase expressing something possessed and a word or phrase expressing the
possessor. In a possessive sentence, one of the basic components occurs in the topic, the other in the
predicate. In a possessive modification construction, the two components are juxtaposed: both may occur
in the topic, or both in the predicate.

There are two main types of possessive sentences in Tagalog. In one, the predicate expresses the thing
possessed, by means of a may phrase: e.g.,

May lapis ang bata.
‘The child has a pencil.’

In the other, the predicate expresses the possessor, by means of asa phrase: e.g.,

Sa bata ang lapis.
‘The pencil belongs to the child.”

(These constructions are dealt with in detail in §4.22.)

There are four types of possessive modification constructions in Tagalog. Two of these belong to the
class of modification constructions introduced in §3.11, and share the essential characteristics of this
class: viz., the components of the construction (the head and the modifier) are connected by the linker

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 135

nafsng: and the head and modifier correspond respectively to the (opie and predicate of an undeilying
constituent sentence. In one of these constructions, the modifier is a possessive may phrase; in the other,

the modifier is a possessive sa phrase. The constituent sentences that underlie the constructions are thus the
(wo types of possessive sentences mentioned above. Examples of the modification constructions are:

batang may lapis
may lapis na bata
‘child with a pencil’ (‘child that has a pencil’)

{irs na sa paral
sa batang lapis
‘the child’s pencil’ (‘pencil that belongs to the child’)

Note that both of these constructions, like most of the other modification constructions dealt with in
§§3.11 through 3.17, allow alternative word order. As was mentioned in §3.14, however, there is a general
preference for placing one-word components of modification structures before phrasal components,
particularly when the phrasal components are long (e.g., if they themselves include modifiers). Thus ‘child
with a new pencil’ would normally be batang may bagong lapis rather than may bagong lapis na bata; and
‘pencil that belongs to the child sitting over there’ would normally be lapis na sa batang nakaupo doon
rather than sa batang nakaupo doong lapis.

As is explained in §4.22, sa itself is optional in a possessive-sa-phrase predicate that involves the sa
form of a personal pronoun. Thus ‘The pencil belongs to me’ may be either of the following:

Sa akin ang lapis.
Akin ang lapis.

When the sa form of a personal pronoun occurs as a possessive modifier, on the other hand, the
presence or absence of sa depends upon whether the pronoun precedes or follows the head. If the pronoun
precedes the head, sa is never used; if the pronoun follows, sa is always used. Thus:

aking lapis?
Nasaan ang
lapis na sa akin?

‘Where is my pencil?’

but not:

sa aking lapis?
*Nasaan ang

lapis na akin?

Of the two occurring possessive modification constructions that involve sa forms of personal
Pronouns, the one in which the pronoun precedes the linker (e¢.g., aking lapis) is very much more common
than the one in which the pronoun follows the linker (e.g., apis na sa akin). The construction in which the
pronoun precedes the linker is, in fact, the only commonly used sa-possessive modification construction.
When the possessor is expressed by something other than a pronoun, there is a strong preference for the
ng-possessive construction, to be presented later in this section.

The third type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the following structure:

Head (Possessor) Linker Modifier (Thing Possessed)

Noun na/-ng Adjective + ang + Noun
eg., batang bago ang lapis

‘child with the new pencil’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
136 CHAPTER 3

This construction differs from the two previously discussed in several ways: it does not allow alternative
word order, and its head and modifier are not directly referable to the topic and predicate of an underlying
constituent sentence. From the point of view of meaning, however, the construction is similar to a
construction with a modifying may phrase that includes within it a modifying adjective: e.g.,

batang may bagong lapis
‘child with a new pencil*

But, while the construction with may generally expresses the thing possessed as indefinite (note the
translation with ‘a’ rather than ‘the’), the construction under discussion always expresses the thing
possessed as definite.

Note that the modifier in this construction has the shape of an ordinary equational
sentence — adjective + ang + noun, Further examples of the construction are:

bulaklak na mahaba ang tangkay
‘flower with the long stem’

babaeng berde ang baro
‘woman with the green dress’

doktor na malaki ang bahay
‘doctor with the big house’

The fourth type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the shape:

Head (Thing Possessed) Modifier (Possessor)
Noun ng Phrase
e.g., lapis ng bata
the
‘child’s pencil’
a

(As in other cases, ng phrase is to be understood as a cover term for: mg plus an unmarked noun; ni or nina
plus a personal noun; the ng form of a personal or deictic pronoun.)

This construction differs from the three previously presented possessive modification constructions in
that it does not include the linker na/-ng, and differs from the first two in that its components are not
directly referable to an underlying constituent sentence, and in the general nonreversibility of its
components. (The ng form of a personal pronoun may, however, in certain cases precede a noun expressing
the thing possessed; see below.)

The possessive-ng-phrase construction is the most common Tagalog translation equivalent of English
possessive modification constructions involving the possessive suffix-, or involving ‘of’: ang buntot ng aso
‘the dog’s tail’, ‘the tail of the dog’. Only when the possessor is a pronoun (expressed in English by my,
your, etc.) is the sa-possessive construction equally common:

{eine lapis}
lapis ko
‘my pencil’

A possessive ng phrase never begins the construction in which it occurs. When the possessor is
expressed by the ng form of a personal pronoun, however, and a modifying adjective precedes the word

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 137

that represents the thing possessed, the pronoun may follow the adjective and precede the noun. Thus, an
alternative to:

maliit na anak ko
‘my little child.”

there is also:
maliit kong anak.
(Note that in the second construction the linker follows the pronoun.) Some further examples are:

bagong baro mo —--e bago mong baro
‘your new dress’

asul na sombrero niya ——— asul niyang sombrero
‘his blue hat’
mahusay na titser natin —e mahusay nating titser

‘our good teacher’

malakas na boses ninyo —_—_—- malakas ninyong boses
‘your loud voices”

tamad na kapatid nila _ tamad nilang kapatid
“their lazy brother’

(This construction involves ENCLITIC behavior of personal pronouns — cf. §3.29.)

In all other cases, a ng form of a personal pronoun used as a possessive modifier immediately follows
the word representing the thing possessed, whether or not another modifier is also present. Thus:

anak kong maliit
‘my little child’

never:

*anak na maliit ko.

A possessive ng phrase other than the ng form of a personal pronoun always follows the word

representing the thing possessed, but another modifier may occur between this word and the ng phrase.
Thus:

anak na maliit ni Maria
‘Maria’s little child’

as well as:
anak ni Mariang maliit.

(Since the latter order is frequently ambiguous — the example just given might mean ‘little Maria's child’ as
well as ‘Maria's little child’ — the order in which the ng phrase follows any other modifiers of the head noun
is often preferable.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
138 CHAPTER 3

To express the equivalent of an English emphatic possessive construction with ‘own’ — e.g., ‘my
own’ — Tagalog uses either a mg-possessive or a sa-possessive modification construction whose head is sarili
‘own, self: e.g.,

Sarili ko

ang bahay.
Aking sarili
‘The house is my own.’

As in other cases, the ng- and sa- possessive constructions are equally common only when the possessor is
expressed by a personal pronoun. When the possessor is expressed by something other than a personal
pronoun, the mg-possessive construction is preferred. Thus ‘The house is Juan's own’ would normally be:

Sarili ni Juan ang bahay.

Emphatic possessive constructions with sarili may themselves be used as modifiers, in which case the
linker na/-ng connects the sarili construction to the word or phrase expressing the thing possessed. When
used as modifiers, emphatic-possessive constructions normally precede the linker:

sarili kong bahay.
Ito ang

aking sariling bahay.
‘This is my own house.”

(Constructions like bahay na sarili ko and bahay na aking sarili may, however, occasionally occur.)

As an alternative to constructions like sarili kong bahay, some speakers allow a construction in which
the ng form of the personal pronoun is separated from sarili and placed after the head noun: sariling bahay
ko. As an alternative to constructions like sarili ni Juang bahay ‘Jaun’s own house’, all speakers allow, and
many prefer, the placement of the ng phrase after the head noun: sariling bahay ni Juan.

(For the use of sarili in reflexive constructions, cf. §3.21.)

§3.21. Reflexive and intensive nominal constructions.

The English *-self/selves’ formations (‘myself, ourselves’, etc.) have two different uses: reflexive, as
in ‘I hurt myself, and intensive, as in ‘I went myself or ‘I myself went’. Tagalog uses distinct constructions
to express the reflexive and the intensive.

The Tagalog counterpart of the English reflexive pronouns is identical in shape with the emphatic
possessive construction discussed in §3.20: viz., a possessive modification construction whose head is sarili
‘self, own’ and whose modifier is either the ng form or the sa form of a personal pronoun. As in the case of

other possessive modification constructions, the ng form follows the head without linking, while the sa
form precedes the head and is joined to it by the linker na-/-ng. Thus:

sarili ko
‘myself?
aking sarili

Some examples of the use of reflexive constructions in sentences are:

sarili ko.
Sinaktan ko ang

aking sarili.
‘[ hurt myself.’

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 139

sarili nila
Nag-aalala sila sa

kanilang sarili
‘They worry about themselves."

Reflexive constructions are normally preceded by either the marker ang or the marker sa. They may
follow the marker ng only under highly specific circumstances, as explained below, and do not occur as
unmarked predicates. (A sarili construction without a marker may occur in predicate position, but only as
an emphatic possessive: ¢.g., Sarili ko iyon ‘That's my own’.)

Reflexive constructions may occur as modifiers (followed by the linker ma/-ng) with a very few
unmarked nouns: roughly, those nouns that translate English nouns that occur before ‘of’ plus a reflexive
pronoun. Some examples are:

sarili niyang

larawan/retrato/foto
kaniyang sasiling
‘a picture/picture (photograph)/photo of himself.’

(The usual equivalent of an ‘of phrase with such nouns is not a modifier, but, rather, a ng phrase of
specification — cf. §3.23. Thus ‘a picture of Manila’ is larawan ng Maynila, not *Maynilang larawan, The
reflexives, however, do not normally occur in ng phrases of specification, and a construction like /arawan ng
sarili niya is of questionable grammaticalness.) Constructions with reflexives used as modifiers are always
ambiguous, since the sarili constructions in them may also be interpreted as emphatic possessives. (English
constructions like ‘his own picture’ are similarly ambiguous, and may mean either ‘a picture of himself or
‘a picture belonging to him’.) When a reflexive construction is used as a modifier, it may be preceded by the
masker ng if this is the appropriate marker for the modification constructions as a whole: e.g.,

sarili niyang

Tumitinging si Pedro ng larawan.
kaniyang sariling

‘Pedro was looking at a picture of himself.’

Except when used as a modifier, a reflexive construction is rarely, if ever, preceded by ng.

The Tagalog counterpart of a construction involving an English intensive pronoun (and of certain
other English constructions -- see below) is a construction involving the intensifier mismo. Mismo may be
used to intensify any marked noun, and any unmarked noun preceded by ang, ng, or sa. (It is, however, less
common with ng phrases than with ang or sa phrases.) Miseno does not occur with unmarked nouns in
predicate position unless the nouns are definitized by a preceding ang (cf. §7.17).

Mismo may cither precede or follow a sentence-initial marked noun. (In the case of personal nouns,
mismo either precedes the personal-noun marker or follows the noun.) When mismo precedes, it is linked to
the nominal by the linker 2a/-ng; when it follows, no linker occurs. Thus:

Mismong ako
Ako mismo

ang pumunta.
Ito mismo

nm ito

Mismong si Huan}
Si Juan mismo

“I myself
‘This one himself went.”

Juan himself

CHAPTER 3

When ntismo is used to intensify an unmarked noun preceded by ang or sa in a sentence-initial phrase,
it may occur in any of three positions. It may precede either the marker or the noun, with linking, or it

may follow the noun, without linking. (The last is the most common.) Thus:

Mismong ang Amerikano

Ang mismong Amerikano? ang pumunta.
Ang Amerikano mismo

‘The American himself went.’

Mismong sa Maynila
Sa mismong na siya nakatira.
Sa Maynila mismo
‘It's in Manila itself that he lives.’

A nominal intensified by mismo most often occurs at the beginning of a sentence. Occasionally,
however, a non-sentence-initial nominal may be intensified by mismo. In such cases, mismo always follows

the nominal:

siya
si Juan
Pumunta mismo.
iyon
ang Amerikano
‘He
‘Juan
went himself."
‘That one

‘The American

niya mismo
ni Juan mismo

Sinabi na maaga pa.

ng Amcrikano mismo
‘He
‘Juan

‘That one
‘The American

sa Amerikano

him."
Juan.”

‘L brought the money to
that one.’
the American.’

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 141

As the last example shows, mtismo is sometimes translatable in English by emphatic stress, rather than
an intensive pronoun. In particular cases, it may have certain other English equivalents as well: e.g., ‘very’
and ‘right? as in:

Sa gitna mismo ng siyudad siya nakatira.
‘He lives in the very heart of the city.”

Dito mismo siya nakatira.
‘He lives right here.’

§3.22. Limiters and limited nominal constructions.

The class of LIMITERS includes various words and phrases that express quantity, distribution, or
order in a series. While some limiters may be classified as nouns and others as adjectives, the members of the
class show certain differences from nouns and adjectives of other types, that make a unified presentation
convenient. (Certain details are, however, presented elsewhere in the text: e.g., the details of the formation
of cardinal and ordinal numbers, presented in §4.4.)

The major limiters are the cardinal and ordinal numbers and the items in the following list:

bahagi ‘part (of)’

bawa’t ‘each, every’

kakaunti ‘only a little’

kalahati ‘half (of)*

kapiraso ‘a piece of”

kaputol ‘a piece of”

karamihan ‘most (of), the majority (of)
kaunti ‘a little, little, few’

hindi (ka)kaunti ‘quite a lot (of), not a little’
hindi gaano ‘not much’

hindi gagaano ‘quite a lot (of), not a little’
hindi iilan ‘quite a few, not a few"

huli ‘(the) last’

iilan ‘only a few’

ilan ‘a few, some, certain”

lahat ‘all’

marami ‘alot (of), lots (of), much many’
parte ‘part (of)’

(The notation hindi (ka)kaunti signifies free alternation between the form with and the form without the
duplicating syllable. Note that the other limiters that include duplicating syllables — kakaunti, hindi
gagaano, and iilan — although related in meaning to their nonduplicated counterparts — Aaunti, hindi gaano,
and ilan respectively — do not alternate freely with them.)

Two of the limiters, bawa't and lahat, are dealt with individually later in this section. The remaining
limiters are dealt with in groups, immediately below, in relation to structures of four types: unmarked

predicates, modification constructions, limiter-plus-sa-phrase constructions, and limiter-plus-ng-phrase
constructions.

The limiters that commonly occur as unmarked predicates are: the cardinal and ordinal numbers,
kakaunti, kaunti, hindi (ka)kaunti, hindi, gaano, hindi gagaano, hindi iilan, huli, iilan, and marami. The
cardinal numbers, hindi iilan and iilan normally occur as predicates only with count-noun topics (cf. §3.9):

Dalawa (wo
Hindi iilan ang bulaklak. ‘There are quite a few flowers.’
lilan only a few

(Literally: ‘The flowers are two,’ etc.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
a a

142 CHAPTER 3

(The topic is optionally pturalized with (hindi) iilan, but not with cardinal numbers. Thus, also: (Hindi)
iilan ang mga bulaklak, but not: *Dalawa ang mga bulaklak).

Kakaunti, kaunti, hindi (ka)kaunti, hindi gagaano and hindi gaano

normally occur as predicates with mass-noun topics:

Kakaunti only a little
Kaunti little
(ka)kaunti ) } ang kape. ‘There is quite alotof > coffee.‘
Hindi
gagaano not much
Hindi gaano

(Literally: ‘The coffee is only a little, etc.)

They may, however, also occur with count-noun topics when the count noun is interpreted as expressing an
undifferentiated collection rather than an assemblage of individuals. Thus, if one were talking about a
collection of small flowers perceived as a mass, one might say Kakaunti ang bulakiak, but if the flowers
were large and perceived individually, one would say only Jilan ang bulaklak. A count noun occurring as
topic opposite kKakaunti, kakaunti, hindi (ka jkaunti, hindi gaano, ox hindi gagaano is never pluralized.

(As predicates, filan, kakaunti, and kaunti are frequently, but not obligatorily, followed by the
enclitic particle la/majig ‘only’ (cf. §6.4): lilan lafima)ng ang (mga) bulaklak ‘There are only a few
flowers’, (Ka)kaunti la(majng ang kape ‘There is only a little coffee’. The presence of la(majmg after
kakaunti or iilan does not affect the meaning, since these words themselves mean respectively, ‘only a little’
and ‘only a few’. After Kaunti, however, la(maJng adds the meaning ‘only’.

Marami may occur as predicate with either a count-noun or a mass-noun topic:

(mga) bulaklak are flowers.’
Marami ang ‘There alot of

kape is coffee.”

flowers are
(Literally: ‘The a lot.”

coffee is

Ordinal numbers and Audi usually occur with count-noun topics:

Una first.”
ang batang ito. ‘This child is
Huli last.’

but may occur with mass-noun topics as well:

Una ang sopas; ikalawa ang karne; huli ang kape.
‘The soup is first, the meat second, the coffee last.”

As the preceding examples show, Tagalog sentences whose predicates are limiters expressing quantity
(i.¢., limiters other than ordinal numbers and Auli) are frequently translated by ‘There is’ or ‘There are’
constructions in English. When, however, the topic noun of the Tagalog sentence is modified by a possessive
ng or sa phrase (cf. §3.20), the normal English equivalent involves ‘has’ or ‘have’:

Dalawa two
lilan ang kaibigan ni Jose. ‘Jose has only a few friends.’
Marami many

(Literally: ‘Jose’s friends are two,’ etc.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 143

Kaunti little
ang kanilang pera. ‘They have money
Marami lots of

(Literally: ‘Their money is little,’ etc.)

This type of construction is a very common equivalent of English possessive sentences in which ‘has’ or
‘have’ is followed by an expression of quantity.

As was noted in §3.13, limiters occurring as modifiers in modification constructions headed by
common nouns or personal nouns regularly precede the linker na/-ng. (A cardinal number modifying a
deictic or personal pronoun follows the linker — cf. § §3.13 and 3.15.) The limiters that commonly occur
as modifiers are the same as those that commonly occur as predicates, with the exception of hindi gaano
and the additions of Kalahati, kapiraso, kaputol, and ilan. Kalahati normally modifies a count noun,
kapiraso and Kaputol a mass noun. flan, which normally modifies a count noun, is equivalent to English ‘a
few’, or to ‘some’ when the latter is interchangeable with ‘certain’:

Gusto ng ilang (mga) tao ang klima roon.

“A few
‘Some people like the climate there.’
‘Certain

(When ‘some’ is used as an indefinite article, it is normally untranslated in Tagalog: e.g.

Nagdala siya ng (mga) mansanas.
‘He brought some apples.)

Some examples of limiters in modification constructions are:

dalawang
hindi iilang (mga)
iilang (mga)
ilang (mga)
Kumain siya ng maraming (mga) mansanas.
kalahating

A construction consisting of a limiter plus a sa phrase or a ng phrase expresses a selection from the
grouping designated by the sa or ng phrase. In general, count-noun groupings are designated by sa phrases,
mass-noun groupings by ng phrases. (Explicit pluralization of a count noun in asa phrase after a limiter is
normal, although mga is occasionally omitted.) Thus:

sa (mga) mangga.
Kumain si Nena ng marami
ng kanin.
mangoes.’
‘Nena ate a lot of the
ice.’

However, when a count-noun grouping is designated by a nonpluralized deictic pronoun, or by a
modification construction beginning with a deictic pronoun, the ng form of the pronoun is used:

nito
marami
nitong (mga) bulaklak na ito

these”
‘a lot of
these flowers’

(In marami nito, the deictic may also refer to a mass-noun grouping, in which case the phrase means ‘a lot
of this.’) If the deictic pronoun is explicitly pluralized, the marker sa is used:

marami sa mga ito ‘a lot of these’

(After marami — but not after other limiters — there is some variation in the use of sa and ng phrases. While
some speakers follow the generalization given above, two other patterns are found in the case of nominals

other than deictics:
(1) Some speakers use only sa phrases, regardless of whether a mass- or count-noun grouping is
designated; thus, for these speakers:

Kumain si Nena ng marami sa

(mga) mangga.
kanin.

(2) Some speakers use ng and sa interchangeably; thus, for these speakers:
(mga) mel
kanin.

Limiters that commonly occur with sa phrases (or the ng form of a deictic) are: the cardinal and
ordinal numbers, karamihan, huli, iilan, ilan, and marami, Some examples are:

ng
Kumain si Nena ng marami
sa

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 145

dalawa ‘two

ikalawa “the second

karamihan ‘most

huli sa (mga) bata ‘the last of the children’
iilan ‘only a few

ilan ‘some

marami ‘a lot

(Karamihan differs from the other limiters that take sa phrases in that in most cases it allows free
alternation between the sa phrase and a ng phrase. Thus: Karamihan ng (mga) bata ‘most of the children’,
as well as karamihan sa (mga) bata. There is, however, no ng-phrase equivalent for sa plus a personal
pronoun after karamihan: ‘most of them’ is only karamihan sa kanila. Mass nouns do not occur in phrases
following Karamihan. The usual equivalent of English ‘most of plus a mass noun is expressed in Tagalog by
malaking bahagi or malaking parte (literally ‘a large part’) plus a ng phrase: e.g.,

bahagi
malaking ng kape ‘most of the coffee.’)
parte

(Kakaunti and kaunti occur occasionally before a sa phrase when the phrase is interpreted as expressing an
undifferentiated collection: e¢.g.,

(ka)kaunti sa (mga) bulaklak ‘(only) a litte of the flowers.’)

Limiters (other than Karamihan and lahat) that commonly occur with ng phrases are: bahagi,
Kakaunti, kalahati, kapiraso, kaputol, kaunti, marami, and parte.

Some examples are:

bahagi ‘part

kakaunti ‘only a little

kalahati ‘half

ng lupa of the land’

kaunti ‘alittle

marami ‘alot

parte ‘part

(Kalahati differs from the other limiters that take ng phrases in that the noun within the ng phrase may be a
count noun. Thus, also: kalahati ng mansanas ‘half of the apple’.)

Bawa't ‘each, every’ commonly occurs before the cardinal number isa ‘one’ in constructions of two
types: modification constructions, and limiter-plus-sa-phrase constructions:

bawa't isang babae ‘each/every woman’
bawa’t isa sa mga babae ‘each of the women’

dsa may be omitted after bawa’t in modification constructions. When isa is omitted, the linker that follows
it is also omitted. The meaning of the construction is not affected by the omission of isa:

bawa’t babae ‘each/every woman’

A nominalized verbal (cf. §3.24) may replace a noun after bawa’'t (isang). The resultant construction
is equivalent to English constructions with ‘each/every one/thing/place who/that’: e.g.,

magluluto
bawa’t (isang) nagluluto

nagluto

‘each one

‘everyone

{ee ee that he is doing’

‘every thing did’
pupuntahan
bawa’t (isang) pinupuntahan niya
pinuntahan
will go”
{leach place \ that he is going’
‘every place went?

(The nominalized verbal may include the usual actor and/or object and/or directional complements — cf.
§2.11. Thus: bawa't (isang) nagbigay ng pera sa mga mahihirap ‘everyone who gave money to the poor’,

etc.)
In the above examples, bawa’t (isang) is followed by one of the three aspect-marked forms of the verb

(contemplated, imperfective perfective — cf. §2.7) that may occur in predicate position in basic sentences.
It may, however, also be followed by the basic form of the verb (cf. §2.8), in which case the action
expressed by the verb is unspecified with regard to aspect: i.e., with regard to whether or not it has been
begun and/or completed. In the English equivalent, the verb is usually a simple present form ending in
-s/-es: ¢g.,

bawa’t (isang) magluto

‘each one

who cooks’
“everyone
bawa't (isang) gawin niya
“each thing

that he does’
‘every thing

bawa’t (isang) puntahan niya

“each place
that he goes’

‘every place

Constructions introduced by bawa’t are normally preceded by one of the markers ang, ng, and
Sa: e.g.,

Uminom ng kape ang bawa’t (isang) babae.
‘Each woman drank some coffee.’

Kaibigan siya ng bawa’t isa sa mga babae.
‘She is a friend of each of the women.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 147

Magbigay ka noon sa bawa’t (isang) babae.
‘Give some of that to each woman.’

(Bawa t constructions do not occur as unmarked predicates. The marker ang may, however, be optionally
deleted before a topic bawa’t construction occurring in sentence-initial position as a result of
ay-inversion — cf. §7.2. Thus:

Bawa’t

babae ay uninom ng kape.
Ang bawa’t
‘Each woman drank some coffee.’)

Lahat ‘all’ may be followed by ng phrases of the following types: ng plus a mass noun, ng plus a
count noun (with optional explicit pluralization), the mg form of a deictic pronoun, ng plus an explicitly
pluralized deictic pronoun. Examples are:

ng kape the coffee”

ng (mga) babae the women’
lahat ‘all (of)

nito this/these’

ng mga ito these”

There is no parallel construction involving personal pronouns. ‘All of us/you/thenv’ is expressed instead by a
construction in which the pronoun is initial and is followed by the linker -ng plus /ahat. The pronoun is an
ang, ng, or sa form, according to its sentence function. Thus:

Narito na silang lahat.
‘All of them are here now.”

Siya ang nanay nilang lahat.
‘She is the mother of all of them’

Binili ko ito para sa kanilang lahat.
‘I bought this for all of them.’

Lahat also occurs independently (i.e., without an accompanying ng phrase or personal pronoun plus
linker), in which case it may, according to the context, be equivalent to English ‘everything’ or
‘everyone’: e.g.,

Narito ang lahat.
‘Everyone/every thing is here.’

(Lahat, or a construction consisting of lahat plus a ng phrase, is normally preceded by one of the
markers ang, ng, or sa. It may, however, like baww 't (see above), occur without a marker in sentence-initial
position as a result of the optional deletion of ang in an ay-inversion construction — cf. §7.2. Thus:

Lahat
ay narito.
Ang lahat

‘Everyone/every thing is here.”)
In free alternation with a lahat-plusng-phrase construction serving as the topic of a sentence (after

ang) there occurs a construction in which the linker -ng or the linker na/-ng plus lahat occurs after the first
word of the sentence (plus any enclitic pronouns or particles — cf. §§3.29 and 6.2-6.6). Thus:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
148 CHAPTER 3

ba ang lahat ng mga bata?
Natutulog

bang lahat ang mga bata?
‘Are all of the children sleeping?"

The linker-plus-lahat construction always refers to the topic of the sentence:

Bumasang lahat ng mga libro ang mga bata.
‘All of the children read books.’

Binasang Jahat ng mga bata ang mga libro.
‘The children read all of the books.”

As noted above, the linker in this construction may be either -ng or na/-ng. (For characteristics of these two
linkers, cf. §§3.8 and 3.11.) Thus, if the linker follows a word ending in a consonant other than /h/, /’/,
or{n/, it may be manifested either as a zero-form or as the word na

Natutulog lahat
ang mga bata.

Natutulog na lahat
‘All of the children are sleeping.”

A deictic pronoun serving as the topic of a sentence including a linker-plus{ahat construction may
optionally be treated as an enclitic, in which case it immediately precedes the linker. Thus:

Binili ba itong lahat ng Nanay?
‘Did Mother buy all of these?”

as well as:

Binili bang lahat ng Nanay ito?

§3.23. Ng phrases of specification.

Several types of expanded nominal constructions that consist of or include a noun followed by ang
phrase are presented in other sections of this text. Among these constructions are: constructions in which
an object ng phrase follows a derived noun with a verbal base: e.g., hiraman ng pera ‘place for borrowing
money’ (cf. §3.7, derived noun classes (1), (12), (15}(17)); constructions in which a ng phrase expresses a
specific selection after an expression of measure, amount, ctc., or after a limiter, e.g., isang salop ng bigas
‘one ganta of the rice,’ Kalahati ng mansanas ‘half of the apples’ (cf. §§3.17 and 3.22); and possessive
modification constructions: e.g., buntot ng aso ‘dog’s tail’ (§3.20). The present section is concerned with
certain other expanded nominal constructions of the shape noun + ng + noun, constructions such as:

buwan ng Agosto ‘month of August’
grupo ng babae ‘group of women’
mina ng karbon ‘coal mine’
sakit ng ulo ‘headache’

The ng phrases that occur in these constructions serve to specify the referent of the preceding noun, and
may be called PHRASES OF SPECIFICATION.

Constructions that include ng phrases of specification may be divided into a number of classes on the
basis of the kind of specification expressed by the mg phrase. Among the more productive of these classes
are APPELLATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS, COMPONENTIAL CONSTRUCTIONS, and CONTENTIVE
CONSTRUCTIONS

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

Some examples of appellative constructions are:

araw ng Lunes
‘day’ ‘Monday’

Bundok ng Banahaw
‘mountain’ ‘Banahaw’

lalawigan ng Batangas
‘province’ ‘Batangas’

Look ng Maynila
‘bay’ ‘Manila’

siyudad ng Maynila
‘city’ ‘Manila’

149

‘Monday’

‘Mount Banahaw’

‘province of Batangas’

‘Manila Bay’

‘city of Manila’

In these constructions, the ng phrase specifies the name of a period of time, geographic phenomenon,
or political division designated by the preceding noun. When the first noun represents a geographic
phenomenon, there is in some cases alternation between the appellative construction and a nominal
compound (cf. §3.8); in other cases only an appellative construction may be used, and in still others, only a
compound. For example, the names of mountains usually show alternation (Bundok ng Banahaw or
Bundok-Banahaw ‘Mount Banahaw’), while the names of bays allow only an appellative construction (Look
ng Maynila ‘Manila Bay’) and the names of rivers only a compound (/log-Pasig ‘(the) Pasig River’).

Examples of componential noun-plus-mg-phrase constructions are:

balasa ng baraha
‘deck’ = ‘card’

| Katipunan ng kuwento
‘collection’ ‘story’

kawan ng isda
‘group’ ‘fish’

koponan ng manlalaro
‘team’ ‘player’

grupo ng babae
‘group’ ‘woman’

hanay ng tao
‘line’ ‘person’

‘deck of cards’

‘collection of stories’

‘school of fish’

‘team of players’

‘group of women’

‘line of people”

In these constructions, the ng phrase specifics the units of which the collection or group designated by the

first noun is composed.

Examples of contentive noun-plus+1g-phrase constructions are:

bote ng pomada
‘bottle’ ‘pomade’

bukid ng palay
| ‘field’ ‘rice’

‘pomade bottle’

‘rice field*
150 CHAPTER 3

kahon ng sapatos ‘shoe box*
‘box’ ‘shoe’
hardin ng rosas ‘rose garden*

’

‘garden’ ‘rose

lata ng serbesa ‘beer can’
‘can’ ‘beer’
mina ng karbon ‘coal mine’

‘mine’ ‘coal’

In these constructions, the mg phrase specifies what the receptacle or place designated by the first
noun is meant to contain. (As was noted in §3.17, a complex modification construction is normally used to
designate what a receptacle — regardless of its original purpose — actually contains: thus: isang latang
serbesa ‘a can of beer’ vs. lata ng serbesa ‘(a) beer can’.)

In addition to appellative, componential, and contentive constructions, ng phrases of specification
occur in a variety of other constructions. Most of these constructions, like those already presented, are
translated either by noun-of-noun constructions or by nominal compounds in English. Some examples are:

banda ng musika “band*
‘band’ ‘music’

klase ng Ingles ‘English class’
‘class’ ‘English’

guro ng Tagalog ‘Tagalog teacher’
‘teacher’ ‘Tagalog’
larawan ng bahay ‘
‘picture’ ‘house’

picture of a house’

sakit ng ulo ‘headache’
‘illness’ ‘head’

taon ng kapanganakan ‘year of birth’
‘year’ = ‘birth’

§3.24. Nominalized adjectivals and verbals.

In the analysis of the structure of Tagalog basic sentences presented in Chapter 2, a severely limited
distribution is assigned to adjectivals and verbals. While nominals are described as occurring in a variety of
positions in basic sentences, adjectivals and verbals are described as occurring in predicate position only.
This restriction upon the distribution of adjectivals and verbals in basic sentences is, however, largely a
matter of analytic and expository convenience; for, as noted in §2.2, Tagalog adjectivals and verbals may
actually occupy most of the same sentence positions as unmarked nouns.

In a derived sentence, then, an adjectival or verbal may occupy virtually any sentence position that, in
a basic sentence, is occupied exclusively by an unmarked noun: e.g., topic position after ang, complement
position after ng or sa. Similarly, an adjectival or verbal may replace an unmarked noun in most of the
derived constructions — e.g., the ng-possessive construction (§3.19) — which are introduced as involving
nominals only. An adjectival or verbal used as something other than an unmarked predicate or a
modifier — modifiers are derived from predicates, as explained in §3.11 ~ is said to be NOMINALIZED, or
aNOMINALIZATION

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 151

Tagalog adjectivals and verbals undergo no change of form when they are nominalized. Their English
equivalents, on the other hand, usually involve the addition of the pronoun ‘one(s)’, or of ‘one(s)’ and a
relative pronoun, to the adjectival or verbal itself. Thus:

bago.

para sa iyo.
lyon ang

bumagsak.

binili ko.

new one."

one for you.”
‘That's the

one that fell.’

one (that) I bought.’

Like unmarked nouns, nominalizations are pluralized by a preceding mga:

bago.

para sa iyo.
lyon ang mga

bumagsak.

binili ko.

new oncs.”
ones for you,”
‘These are the
ones that fell.”
ones (that) I bought.’

(Afga may also be used to pluralize a one-word adjective that is not nominalized — cf. §4.11 — but may not
be used to pluralize an adjective phrase or a verbal other than a nominalization. Thus the following do not
occur:

para sa iyo

*Mga bumagsak iyon.)
binili ko

Sentences with nominalizations in topic position often involve a contrastive meaning. The element

being contrasted is expressed in such sentences by the predicate. The English equivalent of the sentences
often involves emphatic intonation or begins with ‘It’s or ‘It was’: ¢.g.,

(Nakita ba niya si Maria?) Hindi, si Rosa ang nakita niya.
he saw Rosa.”

‘(Did he see Maria?) No,
it’s Rosa he saw.’

The contrastive meaning of a sentence with a nominalized adjectival or verbal in topic position may
be made quite explicit by the insertion of CONTRAST-MARKING siya plus the linker -ng between ang
and the nominalization:

Hindi, si Rosa ang siyang nakita niya.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
152 CHAPTER 3

(Contrast-marking siya should not be confused with the ang form of the third-person-singular pronoun (cf.
§3.3). The contrast marker occurs only between ang and a nominalized topic, and is not limited in
reference to the third-person-singular:

Ikaw
ang siyang nakita niya.
Ang mga libro,
you
‘It’s he saw.”
the books

When contrast-masking siya occurs before a goal-focus verb with a ng-pronoun actor complement, the
ng pronoun may occur cither after the verb or immediately after the siya (and before the linker -ng). Thus:

siyang nakita niya.

Si Rosa ang
siya niyang nakita.

Some other examples of sentences with contrast-marking siya are:

Si Rosa ang siyang maganda.
‘It's Rosa who's pretty.’

Si Rosa ang siyang pupunta.
‘It’s Rosa who'll go.”

Si Rosa ang siyang binigyan ng titser ng premyo.
‘It’s Rosa the teacher gave a prize to.’

(These sentences may be compared with the basic sentences:

Maganda si Rosa.
‘Rosa is pretty.

Pupunta si Rosa.
‘Rosa will go.”

Binigyan ng titser ng premyo si Rosa.
‘The teacher gave a prize to Rosa.)

There are certain actor-focus -wm- verbs that occur quite freely as nominalizations but that do not
occur as unmarked predicates (cf. §5.3, class E.2b). For example, the verb fumakot ‘frighten’ docs not
occur as an unmarked predicate, but occurs in such a sentence as:

Ako ang tumakot kay Juan.
{i frightened Juan.” \
‘It was I who frightened Juan.’

These necessarily-nominalized -us- verbs are used principally when the speaker intends to call special
attention to the performer of the action, an intention that is realized by expressing the performer in the
predicate and nominalizing the verb. (When no special attention is being called to the performer, a
goal-focus counterpart of the -um- verb is used. Thus:

Tinakot ko si Juan
‘I frightened Juan.”)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

The -um- verbs may also occur in other nominalized positions: e.g.,

Ano ang gagawin nila sa tumakot kay Juan?
‘What will they do to the one who frightened Juan?’

153

As was noted in §3.11, a nominalization may serve as the head of a modification construction: e.g.,

bagong binili mo kahapon?
Nasaan ang

inilarawan mong napakamahal?

new one you bought yesterday?
‘Where’s the

one you described that’s so expensive?"

Some further examples of the use of nominalized adjectivals and verbals are:

maingay.
Ginambala siya ng nasa likuran ng silid.
kumakain.

‘The noisy one
‘The one at the back of the room interrupted him.’
‘The one who was eating

‘I gave the package to the one who had a receipt.’

mayaman.
Iyan ang kotse ng nasa bahay.

‘That’s the one in the house’s car.’

§3.25. Nominalized basic forms.

The nominalized verbals presented in §3.24 are identical in form with verbals occurring as predicates
of basic sentences. The same three aspect-marked forms that occur in unmarked verbal predicates (the

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
154 CHAPTER 3

contemplated, imperfective, and perfective forms - cf. §2.7) occur in nominalized verbals of the type
presented. Compare, for example, the verbal predicates in:

Magsasalita
Nagsasalita si Rosa.

Nagsalita

will speak.”
‘Rosa is speaking.’

spoke’
and the nominalized verbals in:

magsasalita.
Si Rosa ang nagsasalita.
nagsalita.

will speak
‘The one who is speaking is Rosa.’
spoke

or the verbal predicates in:

Huhugasan
Hinuhugasan ni Rosa ang mga pinggan.
Hinugasan

will wash
‘Rosa is washing the dishes.”
washed

and the nominalized verbals in:

huhugasan
Mga pinggan ang hinuhugasan ni Rosa.
hinugasan

will wash
‘What Rosa is washing is some dishes.”
washed

In addition to nominalized verbals of this type, Tagalog has certain nominalized verbals that differ in
form from verbals that occur as predicates of basic sentences. These nominalized verbals are of three
types: NOMINALIZED BASIC FORMS, GERUNDS, and nominalized verb bases. Nominalized basic forms
are dealt with in the present section, gerunds in §3.26 and nominalized verb bases in §3.27.

A nominalized basic form, like any other basic verb form (cf. §2.8), consists of the basic form of an
affix plus a verb base. Thus smagsalita, which consists of the basic affix mag- and the base salita, is the basic
form that corresponds to the aspect-marked forms magsasalita, nagsasalita, and nagsalita, while hugasan,
which consists of the basic affix -an and the base Augas, is the basic form that corresponds to huhugasan,
etc.

A nominalized basic form designates a type of activity. It is usually translatable by cither ‘to’ plus a
verb or the ‘-ing’ form of a verb in English. A sentence that includes a nominalized basic form says
something about the type of activity designated by the basic form:
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 155

Madaling magsalita.
‘To speak

is easy.”
‘Speaking

Laban sa batas higaan ang damo.

‘To lie
on the grass is against the law.’
“Lying

Unlike the nominalizations presented in §3.24, which may occur in virtually any context in which an
unmarked noun occurs (¢.g., after ang, ng, or sa) nominalized basic forms occur in only a few special
contexts. No nominalized basic forms occur after ng or sa, and only the basic forms of actor-focus verbs
occur after ang. (See §2.10 for a discussion of verb focus.)

The most common construction in which a nominalized basic form occurs is one in which it serves as
sentence topic. A nominalized actor-focus basic form serving as sentence topic may be preceded by either
the topic marker ang or the linker -ng. (The linker -ng — cf. §3.8 — has one overt form, /n/, which occurs as
a replacement of a final /*/, /h/, or /n/ in the preceding word, and one zero form — i.c., a form without
phonemic content ~— which occurs in all other contexts. Thus madali /madali’/ plus the linker is madaling
/madalin/, while batas foatas/ plus the linker is simply batas.) The constructions with ang and -ng, alternate
freely with one another:

Maaksayang
‘To throw away clothing is wasteful.”

Maaksaya ang
magtapon ng damit.

A nominalized goal-focus basic form serving as sentence topic is always preceded by the linker -ng:

Maaksayang itapon ang damit.
‘To throw away the clothing is wasteful.”

A nominalized basic form serving as a sentence topic is never followed by a phrase expressing a
performer. Thus nominalized actor-focus basic forms are not followed by an ang phrase, and nominalized
goal-focus basic forms are not followed by a mg-phrase actor complement. (In basic sentences, it is an ang
phrase (the topic of the sentence) that expresses the performer after an actor-focus verb, and a ng-phrase
actor complement that expresses the performer after a goal-focus verb.) Except for phrases expressing the
performer, any of the various types of phrases that may follow the aspect-marked forms of a verb may
follow the nominalized basic form. Thus, a nominalized actor-focus basic form may be followed by any of
the usual complements (an object and/or directional and/or secondary-actor complement — cf. §§2.11 and
5.12), and a nominalized goal-focus basic form may be followed by its topic, and by any complements
other than actor complements: e.g.,

Magugol magpadala sa kanila ng bigas sa Maynila.
‘To have them take rice to Manila is expensive.’

(cf. Nagpadala siya sa kanila ng bigas sa Maynila.)
‘He had them take rice to Manila.’

Magugo! ibili ng bigas sa groseri ang pamilya.
‘To buy rice for the family from a grocery is expensive.’

(cf. Ibinili niya ng bigas sa groseri ang pamilya.
‘He bought rice for the family from a grocery.’

CHAPTER 3

The predicate of a sentence whose topic is a nominalized basic form must be one of a rather small
group of adjectivals or nominals, or of verbals that include goal-focus verbs. Examples of adjectivals and
nominals that may occur as predicates with basic form topics are:

Adjectivals: bagay (+ sa phrase)
bawal

laban sa batas
maaksaya

mabuti

madali

magastos

magugol

mahalay

mahirap
mainam

mapanganib
masagwa
masama
matrabaho
nakakabagot
nakakainis
nakakapagod
nakakawili
nakakatakot

abala
basag-ulo
kabayanihan
kalokohan

Nominals:

‘suitable’ ( + ‘for’ phrase)
‘prohibited’

‘against the law”
‘wasteful’

‘good’

‘easy"

‘expensive’

“expensive”

‘indecent’

‘difficult’

‘good’

‘dangerous’
‘disagreeable’

‘bad’

‘involving a lot of work’
‘boring’

‘annoying’

‘tiring’

“entertaining”
‘frightening’

‘(a) bother’
‘trouble’
‘heroism’
‘foolishness’

Some examples of sentences with adjectival or nominal! predicates and nominalized-basic-form topics

are:

Mapanganib ang
lumapit sa ahas.
Mapanganib
‘To go near a snake is dangerous.”

Matrabaho ang
magluto ng lumpia.
Matrabahong
‘Cooking lumpia involves a lot of work.”
Kalokohan ang
magsugal.
Kalokohang

‘Gambling is foolishness.’

Mabuting bigyan ng pera ang mga mahihirap.

‘To give money to the poor is good.’

Mahirap basahin ang librong iyan.
‘To read that book is difficult.’

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 157

(Some sentences in which an adjective is followed by the linker -ng and a goal-focus basic form are
ambiguous, and may be interpreted either as involving the construction under discussion, in which the
adjective is a predicate, characterizing the type of activity designated by the nominalized basic form, or as
involving the adjective-plus-basic-form-complement constnuction discussed in §4.17, in which the adjective
and the basic form function together as a predicate, jointly characterizing what the topic of the sentence
designates. Thus the last example given, Mahirap basahin ang librong iyan, may mean either ‘To read that
book is difficult’, or ‘That book is difficult to read’. Other sentences in which an adjective is followed by
the linker -ng and a goal-focus basic form are, however, unambiguously either examples of sentences with
nominalized basic forms or examples of adjective-plus-complement constructions. Thus Laban sa batas
basahin ang librong iyan ‘To read that book is against the law’ can be interpreted only as including a
nominalized basic form (since /aban sa batas does not accept a basic-form complement), while Afagaling
basahin ang librong iyan ‘That book is excellent to read’ can be interpreted only as including an
adjective-plus-complement construction (since magaling does not occur as a predicate opposite a basic-form
topic).)

Goal-focus verbs of three types occur in predicates before basic-form topics. These are:

(1) object-focus verbs (cf. §5.3): e.g.,

balakin ‘plan’
ipagbawal ‘forbid’
ipahintulot ‘allow’
isipin ‘plan’
tangkain ‘attempt’

(2) directional-focus verbs (cf. §5.4): ¢.g.,

ilagan ‘avoid’

iwasan ‘avoid’
katamaran “be lazy about’
katuwaan ‘be amused at’
katakutan ‘be afraid of

(3) causative-focus verbs (cf. §5.8): ¢.g.,

ikagalak “be pleased about’
ikahiya ‘be ashamed about’
ikalugod ‘be happy about’
ikalungkot ‘be unhappy about”
ikatuwa “be happy about’

These verbs are normally followed by an actor complement, and then by the nominalized basic form topic,
Some examples are:

— ko ang

mamalengke.
Binalak kong
‘I planned to go marketing.’

Inilagan ni Juan ang

mag-aral ng Kastila.
Inilagan ni Juang

‘Juan avoided studying Spanish.’

Ikinagalak ng titser ang
pumunta sa bagong iskwela.
Ikinagalak ng titser
‘The teacher was pleased about going to a new school.”

Ipinagbabawal ng batas lakaran ang daan.
‘The law forbids walking in the street.”

Kinatatamaran niyang gawin ang trabaho.
‘He is lazy about doing the work.’

Ikinalulungkot ni Manuel isulat siya ng liham.
‘Manuel is unhappy about writing a letter for him.”

In addition to the constructions already presented, in which basic forms serve as sentence topics,
there are certain other constructions in which nominalized basic forms occur. In these constructions, the
basic form is always actor-focus and is preceded by either the linker -ng or the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11).
The constructions all involve verbal predicates introduced by the actor-focus counterparts of goal-focus
verbs like those listed above: i.e., goal-focus verbs that occur in predicate position before basic-form topics.
The actor-focus verbs that correspond to the verbs listed above are:

(1) magbalak ‘plan’
magbawal ‘forbid’
magpahintulot ‘allow’
mag-isip ‘plan’
magtangka ‘attempt’

(2) umilag ‘avoid’
umiwas ‘avoid’
matamad ‘be lazy about’
matuwa ‘be amused at”
matakot ‘be afraid of

(3) magalak ‘be pleased’
mahiya ‘be ashamed’
malugod ‘be happy”
malungkot ‘be unhappy’
matuwa “be happy’

The verbs in the first group correspond to object-focus verbs that take nominalized-basic-form topics. After
the verbs in this group, a nominalized basic form functions as a replacement of a mg-phrase object
complement (cf. §2.11): ¢.g.,

Nagbalak akong mamalengke.
‘I planned to go marketing.’

(cf. Nagbalak ako ng gawain.
‘I planned an activity.’)

The verbs in the second group correspond to directional-focus verbs that take nominalized-basic-form
topics. After the verbs in this group, a nominalized basic form functions as a replacement of a sa-phrase
directional complement (cf. §2.11): ¢.g.,

Umilag (na) mag-aral ng Kastila si Juan.
‘Juan avoided studying Spanish.’

(cf. Umilag sa gawain si Juan
‘Juan avoided the activity.’)

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 159

The verbs in the third group correspond to causative-focus verbs that take nominalized-basic-form topics;
After the verbs in this group, a nominalized basic form functions as a replacement of a dahil-sa-phrase
causative adverbial (cf. §6.11 subsection (1.b)): e.g.,

Nagalak ang titser (na) pumunta sa bagong iskwela.
‘The teacher was pleased about going to a new school.’

(cf. Nagalak ang titser dahil sa gawain.
‘The teacher was pleased about the activity.”)

§3.26 Gerunds.

Gerunds, like nominalized basic forms, are in many cases translatable by the ‘-ing’ form of a verb in
English. Gerunds differ from basic forms, however, in the way in which they are formed, the range of
meanings they express, and the contexts in which they occur.

There are two different types of gerund formations, one of which designates an action without
indicating whether or not it is viewed as completed, the other of which designates an action viewed as
completed. The first of these, which may be called the ASPECTLESS GERUND, is often translated by the
‘ing’ form of a verb in English; the second, which may be called the PERFECTIVE GERUND, is often
translated by ‘having’ plus the past participle of a verb in English. Thus pagsasalita and pag/ka )ka(pag jsalita,
which are respectively the aspectless and perfective gerunds that correspond to magsalita ‘speak’, are
equivalent to ‘speaking’ and ‘having spoken’ respectively in the following sentences:

Pinarusahan si Juan dahil sa pagsasalita sa klase.
‘Juan was punished for speaking in class.’

Pinarusahan si Juan dahil sa pag(ka)ka(pag)salita sa klase.
‘Juan was punished for having spoken in class.”

In the first sentence, the use of pagsasalita docs not indicate whether or not the ‘speaking’ is viewed as
completed: Juan may or may not have finished speaking before he was punished. In the second sentence,
the use of pag(ka}ka(pagkalita makes it clear that Juan had already finished speaking when he was
punished.

Just as there are many situations in which an English speaker may use either the ‘-ing’ form of a verb
or ‘having’ plus a past participle, so there are many situations in which a Tagalog speaker may use either the
aspectless or the perfective gerund. If an action is definitely viewed as incomplete, only the aspectless
gerund may be used; but if the action is viewed as complete, the speaker may or may not choose to specify
the completedness of the action through the use of the perfective gerund.

Gerunds, both aspectless and perfective, are formed by replacing certain affixes found in the basic

forms of actor-focus verbs with other affixes. The affixes that occur in the gerunds vary according to the
affixes that occur in the corresponding basic forms. Chart 9 shows the aspectless gerund formations that

correspond to the various actor-focus basic forms. (If an actor-focus basic form is not included on the chart,
there is no corresponding aspectless gerund formation.) On the chart, prefixes are followed by a hyphen,
suffixes preceded by a hyphen, infixes written between hyphens; B represents the verb base, pre- any prefix
that may occur in the given position, and dup,- a prefix normally consisting of a duplication of the first
consonant and first vowel of the immediately following syllable. (cf. §3.7 for a detailed presentation of the
formation of dup,-.) The vowels of pag-, pang-, pagka-, and pa- are short; the length of vowels in bases and
in any prefix(es) that occur in both the basic form and the gerund is identical in the two formations.)

CHART 9

BASIC FORMS AND CORRESPONDING ASPECTLESS GERUNDS
Basic Form Aspectless Gerund
(1) -um+B ——+ __ pag- +B
(2) mag- (+ pre-) +B ———+ __ pag- + dup, -( + pre-) + B
(3) mang- + B ——+  pang- + dup,-+B
(4) ma- +B —---> _ pagka- + B
(S) ma- + ki-( + pre-) + B —-»- pa-t+dup,-+ki(+pre-) +B

As the chart shows:
(1) The aspectless gerunds that correspond to -um- verbs are formed by replacing -wn- with pag-.
Examples are:

dumating ‘come’ —- pagdating ‘coming’
pumunta ‘go’ —e pagpunta ‘going’
sumulat ‘write’ — pagsulat ‘writing’

(There are no gerunds — either aspectless or perfective — that correspond to certain -um- verbs whose bases
are also ma- adjective bases — cf. §5.6, Class H. Thus there is no “pagtamis corresponding to tumamis
‘become sweet’, etc. There are, however, gerunds corresponding to other -w- verbs of this type: ¢.g.,
paglaki ‘becoming big’ (cf. kamaki ‘become big’).)

(2) The aspectless gerunds that correspond to basic forms that begin with the prefix mag- (i.c., mag-
verbs, and derived verbs formed with complex prefixes such as magka-, inagpa- ik) are formed by replacing
mag- with pag- plus a duplicating syllable. Examples are:

mag-aral ‘study’ ——~ pag-aaral ‘studying’

magkasalapi ‘acquire money* —-~ pagkakasalapi ‘acquiring money”
magpakabuti ‘try to be very good’ ——~ pagpapakabuti ‘trying to be very good"
magpasulat ‘have (someone) write’ — pagpapasulat ‘having (someone) write’
magsitulong ‘help (plural)’ —- pagsisitulong ‘help (plural)’

(3) The aspectless gerunds that correspond to mang- verbs are formed by replacing mang- with pang-
plus a duplicating syllable. (Whatever assimilations occur with mang- (cf. §5.2, subsection (12)) occur with
pang- as well.) Examples are:

mamangka _‘go boating” —+ pamamangka ‘going boating’
manakot ‘frighten’ ——= pananakot ‘frightening’
manganak ‘give birth’ —-+ panganganak ‘giving birth’

(4) The aspectless gerunds that correspond to ma- verbs are formed by replacing ma- with pagka-.
Examples are:

mabuyo ‘get involved’ —e pagkabuyo ‘getting involved’
mahirati ‘become accustomed’ = — + pagkahirati ‘becoming accustomed’
matunaw ‘melt’ ——e= pagkatunaw ‘melting’

(Those ma- verbs that alternate freely with -um- verbs — cf. §5,4, classes A.) and D.1 — form gerunds on
the pattern of the -wz- verbs only, Thus the aspectless gerund that corresponds to both maupo and umupo

Elements sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 161

‘sit’ is pag-upo; there is no corresponding “pagkaupo. At least two ma- verbs have irregular aspectless
gerunds: the aspectless gerund that corresponds to makinig ‘listen’ is pakikinig ‘listening’, the aspectless
gerund that corresponds to maligo ‘bathe’ is paliligo ‘bathing’. For the gerunds that correspond to the verb
maging, cf. §5.26.)

(5) The aspectless gerunds that correspond to basic forms that begin with the prefix maki- are
formed by replacing the ma- of the prefix by pa- plus a duplicating syllable. Examples are:

makisama ‘accompany” —+  pakikisama ‘accompanying’
makipagtawanan ‘join in laughing” —+»  pakikipagtawanan ‘joining in laughing’
makipangisda ‘join in fishing’ -——» pakikipangisda ‘joining in fishing’

Chart 10 shows the perfective gerund formations that correspond to the various actor-focus basic
forms. The vowel in the prefix written ka- is long. The symbol pre'- represents any prefix other than pa- or
ka- that may occur in the given position. The other symbols are to be interpreted as in Chart 5S.

CHART 10

BASIC FORMS AND CORRESPONDING PERFECTIVE GERUNDS
Basic Form Perfective Gerund
(1) -um- +B ——> pag: (+dup,-) +ka- +B
(2a) mag: ( + pa-) + B ——> pag: (+ dup,-) + ka- ( + pag-) (+ pa-) +B
(2b) mag- + pre'- +B —+ pag: ( + dup,-) + ka- + pag- + pre'- + B
(3) mang- + B ——-» pag- ( + dup, -) + ka- + pang- + B
(4) ma- +B — pag: (+ dup,) + ka-+B
(5) ma- + ki- ( + pre-) + B ——+ pag: ( + dup, -) + ka- + pa- + ki- ( + pre-) + B

As the chart shows, all perfective gerund formations begin with pagka- /pagka:/ or pagkaka-
/pagkaka:/. The two formations are in free alternation for some speakers, while others use only the pagka-
forms. The following further points may be noted:

(1) The perfective gerunds that correspond to -wn- verbs are formed by replacing -wm- with

pag(ka )ka-. Examples are:
dumating ‘come’ — pag(ka)karating ‘having come’
pumunta ‘goo em pag(ka)kapunta ‘having gone’
sumulat ‘write? —= pag(ka)kasulat ‘having written’

(2a) The perfective gerunds that correspond to basic forms of the shape mag- + base or mag- + pa- +
base are formed by replacing mag- with pag(ka)ka(pag }-. Examples are:

mag-aral ‘study’ —- __ pag(ka)ka(pag-)aral ‘having studied’
magpasulat ‘have (someone) write’ ———» _ pag(ka)ka(pag)pasulat ‘having had
(somcone) write’

(There are no distinct perfective-gerund formations that correspond to basic forms that begin with mag- +
ka- (i.e., intensive magka- + dup,- verbs and posscssive-cxistential magka- verbs — cf. §5.16, subsection
(1.d) and §5.28). The aspectless gerunds that correspond to basic forms of this shape may, however, be
used to express perfective as well as aspectless meanings. Thus the aspectless gerund pagkakasira-sira
{pagkaka:sira:sira’/ (cf. magkasira-sira /magka:sira:sisa’} ‘get thoroughly damaged’) may express the
meaning ‘having gotten thoroughly damaged’ as well as the meaning ‘getting thoroughly damaged’, And the
aspectless gerund pagkakasalapi {pagkakasalapi’} (cf. magkasalapi /magkasalapi’/ ‘acquire money’) may
express the meaning ‘having acquired money’ as well as the meaning ‘acquiring money’.)

(2b) The perfective gerunds that correspond to all other basic forms that begin with mag- (i.c., basic
forms in which mag- is immediately followed by something other than a base, pa- plus a base, or Ka- (plus

Eléments sous droits d'auteur

(RS
162 CHAPTER 3

dup2-) plus a base) are formed by replacing mag- with pag/Ka/kapag-. (The only difference between
perfective-gerund formations (2a) and (2b) is that in (2a) the second prefixed pag- is optional, while in (2b)
it is obligatorily present.) Examples are:

magpakabuti “try to be very good’ —~ pag(ka)kapagpakabuti ‘having tried
to be very good’
magsitulong ‘help (plural)’ —+» pag(ka)kapagsitulong ‘having helped (plural)’

(3) The perfective gerunds that correspond to miang- verbs are formed by replacing mang- with
pag(ka)kapang-. Examples are: .

mamangka ‘go boating’ — pag(ka)kapamangka ‘having gone boating’
manakot ‘frighten’ — pag(ka)kapanakot ‘having frightened”
manganak ‘give birth’ —+ pag(ka)kapanganak ‘having given birth’

(4) The perfective gerunds that correspond to ma- verbs are (like those that correspond to -wm-
verbs) formed by replacing ma- with pag/ka)ka-. Examples are:

mabuyo ‘get involved’ —e pag(ka)kabuyo ‘having gotten involved”
mahirati ‘become accustomed’ —+» pag(ka)kahirati ‘having become accustomed’
matunaw ‘melt’ — pag(ka)katunaw ‘having melted*

(When the pagka- form of the prefix is used to form the perfective gerund, the only difference between the
aspectless and perfective gerunds is in the length of the vowel in the prefixed ka-. Thus the aspectless
gerund corresponding to mabuyo is pronounced /pagkabuyoh/, the perfective gerund /pagka:buyoh/. Many
ma- verbs of ‘becoming’, whose bases are usually unaffixed adjectives (cf. §5.6, class e), do not have
distinctive perfective gerunds. Thus there is no perfective gerund *pag(ka)kapagod that corresponds to
mapagod become tired’; the aspectless gerund pagkapagod ‘becoming tired’ does, however, occur.)

(5) The perfective gerunds that correspond to basic forms that begin with the prefix maki- are
formed by replacing the ma- of the prefix by pag(ka)kapa-. Examples are:

makisama ‘accompany’ — pag(ka)kapakisama ‘having
accompanied”

makipagtawanan ‘join in laughing’ ——e pag(ka)kapakipagtawanan = ‘having joined
in laughing’

makipangisda ‘join in fishing’ —~—+» pag(ka)kapakipangisda ‘having joined
in fishing’

(It may be noted that neither Chart 9 nor Chart 10 includes gerunds corresponding to basic forms
that begin with the prefix :maka- (cf. §5.13). This is because most maka- verbs do not have corresponding
gerunds. There are, however, perfective gerund formations corresponding to makakita {maka:ki:tah/ ‘see’
and makarinig /maka:rinig/ ‘hear’. These are, respectively, pag(/kaj)kakita /{pag(ka)ka:ki:tah/ ‘having seen’
and pag(ka)karinig {pag(ka)ka:rinig/ ‘having heard’.

As was noted in §3.24, a nominalized basic form always designates a type of activity. A gerund, on

the other hand, may designate cither a type of activity or some specific performance of an action. Note the
two translations of the following sentence:

Tungkol sa pagsusugal ang lathalaing ito.

gambling’
‘This article is about

the gambling.’

In one interpretation, pagsusugal designates ‘gambling’ as a type of activity; in the other, some particular
performance(s) of the act of gambling (e.g., ‘the gambling (that he observed last night)’ pagsusugal (na
pinanood niya kagabi)) may be designated.

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 163

The performer of the action expressed by a gerund may or may not be designated. If designated, the
performer is expressed by a possessive modifier (cf. §3.20): specifically, cither a ng phrase (ng plus
unmarked noun, (ni/na) plus personal noun, os the mg form of a deictic or personal pronoun) immediately
following the gerund, or the sa form of a personal pronoun plus the linker -ng preceding the gerund:

ng lalaki ‘the man’s
ni Pedro f-reuc'
pagsusugal gambling’
noon {at one’s
niya ‘his
kaniyang pagsusugal ‘his gambling’

The construction that expresses the performer is usually translatable by a possessive before the ‘-ing’ form
in English, sometimes by an ‘of phrase:

‘the dog’s barking’

pagtahol ng aso
‘the barking of the dog’

Gerunds may also be followed by any object and/or directional and/or secondary-actor complements (cf.
§§2.11 and 5.12) taken by the actor-focus verbs to which they correspond:

pagsulat ng liham sa Nanay ‘writing a letter to mother’
pagpapagawa ng trabaho kay Jose ‘having Jose do the work"

A gerund may (like various ‘-ing’-form constructions in English) merely designate an action, or it may
designate ‘the fact that’ an act is performed, or ‘the way that’ an act is performed. Thus, an action is
designated by the gerund in:

Pagluluto ng pagkain ang trabaho niya.
‘Her job is cooking food.’
(‘It’s her job to cook food.’);

‘the fact that’ an act is performed is designated by the gerund in:

Ikinagulat ko ang pag-alis niya.
‘His leaving surprised me.”
(‘The fact that he was leaving surprised me.”);

and ‘the way that’ an act is performed is designated by the gerund in:

Masyadong mabilis ang pagtugtog niya ng piyesa.
‘His playing of the piece is too fast.’
(‘The way that he plays the piece is too fast.”)

Gerunds (in contrast to nominalized basic forms) occur in a wide variety of contexts: as predicates of
basic sentences (only aspectless gerunds occur in this position), after the markers ang, ng, sa, etc. Some
further examples of the uses of gerunds are:

§3.27. Nominalized verb bases.
A NOMINALIZED VERB BASE is a verb base used in a typically nominal position to express a
verb-like, or actional, meaning. Nominalized verb bases occur in only a few special contexts: (1) as

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 165

sentence topics with time or locative adverbs in predicate position; (2) as sentence topics with certain
adjectival and verbal predicates; (3) after ng in exclamations. These uses of nominalized verb bases are
discussed in turn below.

(1) Sentences with time or locative adverbs in predicate position and verb bases in topic position
(after ang) are used to emphasize the fact that an action (the action expressed by the verb base) occurs at a
particular time or place (the time or place denoted by the predicate). Such sentences always convey a
meaning that may also be expressed by a sentence with an emphatic initial time or locative adverb (cf.
§§6.8, 6.9, and 7.2) and a verbal predicate that includes a contemplated-aspect or imperfective-aspect
actor-focus verb. Thus the following sentences are identical in meaning:

Kung Lunes ang dating ng tren.
Kung Lunes dumarating ang tren.
‘Iv’s on Mondays that the train arrives.’

In the first sentence kung Lunes ‘on Mondays’ occupies predicate position (where it functions as a
pseudo-predicate — cf. §6.8) and the verb base dating occupies topic position; in the second sentence kung
Lunes is an emphatic initial adverb and dating occurs within the actor-focus verb dumarating ‘arrives’.
Similarly, the following sentences are identical in meaning:

Dito ang dating ng tren.
Dito dumarating ang tren.
‘It’s here that the train arrives."

(The formal differences between these two sentences are the same as those between the first two sentences,
but the sentence-initial element is a locative adverb — dito ‘here’ — rather than a time adverb.)

The sentence types with the nominalized verb base in topic position may be considered to be derived
from the sentence types with the verbal predicate through the following formal changes: (1) the affix and
aspect marking of the verb are deleted, and the marker ang is placed before the base; (2) the marker ng
teplaces ang before the word (or phrase) that designates the performer. In all other respects the two
sentence types are identical. Thus the same range of time and locative adverbs that may occur in initial
position before contemplated-aspect and imperfective-aspect verbal predicates may occur in predicate
position with nominalized verb base topics: e.g.,

ang dating ng tren.
Noong Lunes sana
darating ang tren.
‘It was last Monday that the train was to have arrived.’

ang dating ng tren.
Sa Lunes
darating ang tren.
‘It’s next Monday that the train is arriving.’

ang dating ng tren.
Sa may harap ng istasyon
dumarating ang tren.
‘It's somewhere in front of the station that the train arrives.”

And the same directional or object complements that occur with the verbal predicates occur with the
nominalized verb bases: ¢.g.,

umaalis sa Maynila ang eruplano.
Kung Lunes

ang alis sa Maynila ng cruplano.
‘It’s on Mondays that the plane leaves Manila.”

166 CHAPTER 3

kumakain ng litson ang kaibigan ko.
Kung Pasko

ang kain ng litson ng kaibigan ko.
‘It’s at Christmastime that my friend cats lechon.’

Only a limited number of verb bases may occupy topic position opposite time or locative
pseudo-predicates. Most of these bases occur as bases of directional or intransitive -um- verbs expressing
motion: e.g., alis )cf. umalis ‘leave’), dating (cf. dumating ‘arrive’), pasok (cf. pumasok ‘enter’), punta (cf.
pumunta ‘go’). A few occur as bases of double-object -m- verbs: ¢.g., inom (cf. uminom “drink’), Kain (cf.
kumain ‘eat’).

(2) As was noted in §3.25,gerunds may be used to designate ‘the way that’ an action is performed, as
in:

Mabilis ang pagtugtog niya ng piyesa.
‘His playing of the piece is fast.’
(‘The way that he plays the piece is fast.’)

When, as in the above sentence, a gerund designating the way that an action is performed occurs in topic
position, it may be replaced by a nominalized verb base. Thus, also:

Mabilis ang tugtog niya ng piyesa.
‘His playing of the picce is fast.’

Nominalized verb bases alternate freely with gerunds in topic position when the predicate is one of a class
of adjectives that may characterize the way in which an action is performed. This class inludes certain
unaffixed adjectives and ma- adjectives (cf. § §4.2 and 4.3), all pa- manner adjectives (cf. §4.7), and all
adjectives prefixed by na- + dup,- + ka, na- + ka- + dup,-, or ka- + dup2- (cf. §4.10, subsections (4) and
(7)). Some examples are:

Unaffixed adjectives: baliktad ‘topsy-turvy’
bigla ‘sudden’
mali ‘incorrect’
tama ‘correct’

Ma: adjectives: mabagal ‘slow’
mabilis ‘fast’
malakas ‘loud, strong’
masama ‘bad’

Pa- manner adjectives: paismid ‘with a grimace”
palundag ‘as if jumping’
pasayaw ‘as if dancing’
patagilid ‘sideways?

Na: + dup,- + ka
adjectives: nakakabighag
Na- + ka- + dup, ‘captivating®
nakabibihag
nakakahiya
‘embarrassing’

‘laughable’

Ka- + dup,- adjectives: kahiya-hiya ‘shameful’
kaibig-ibig ‘adorable’
kawili-wili ‘delightful’

kayamut-yamot “extremely boring’

Some further examples of sentences with adjectival predicates and nominalized verb bases alternating freely
with gerunds in topic position are:

Pagsusuot

Baliktad ang niya ng baro.
suot

‘She put on the dress topsy-turvy.”

(‘Her putting on of the dress was topsy-turvy.")

paglunok

lunok
‘He swallowed the medicine with a grimace.’
(‘His swallowing of the medicine was (done) with a grimace.”)

Paismid ang niya ng gamot.

pagsayaw
Nakakabihag ang niya ng pandanggo.
sayaw

‘Her dancing of the fandango was captivating.’

pagsasalita
Kahiya-hiya ang niya sa iyo.
salita

‘The way he spoke to you was shameful.”

Nominalized verb bases also alternate freely with gcerunds in topic position when the predicate is one
of certain -an verbs. These -art verbs constitute a subclass of the verbs discussed in §5.6 (class A), whose
bases also occur as bases of »na- adjectives and whose general meaning is: ‘make (something) have the
quality expressed by the related adjective’ : ¢.g.,

bagalan ‘make...slow’ (cf. mabagal ‘slow’)
bilisan ‘make...fast* (cf. mabilis ‘fast')

lakasan ‘make...loud/strong” (cf. malakas ‘loud, strong’)
samaan ‘make...bad’ (cf. masama ‘bad’)

Examples of sentences with verbal predicates and nominalized verb bases alternating freely with gerunds in
topic position are:

paglakad }
Bagalan mo ang mo.
lakad j
‘Walk slowly.”

(‘Make your walking slow.”)

168 CHAPTER 3

{ pag-awit.
Linakasan nila ang kanilang

l awit.
‘They sang loudly.”

(‘They made their singing loud.’)

(While most gerunds expressing ‘the way that’ an action is performed are replaceable by nominalized
verb bases in the contexts listed above, there ase certain types of gerunds that do not admit of the
replacement. For example, the verb base cannot replace a gerund derived from a mang- verb. Thus the
gerund pangingisda ‘fishing’, which is derived from the mang- verb mangisda ‘fish’, cannot be replaced by
the base isda in such a sentence as:

Masama ang pangingisda niya.
‘He fished badly.”
(‘The way that he fished was bad.’).)

(3) As is explained in §4.24, exclamations may be derived from sentences with certain types of
adjectival predicates by placing any of several markers (ang, Kay, etc.) before the adjective (or, in some
cases, before the adjective base), and replacing the ang-phrase topic with a ng phrase. Sentences with
adjectival predicates of the appropriate type and nominalized verb base topics (sentences of the type
discussed under (2) above) may be made into exclamations in the usual way. Thus the exclamation that
corresponds to:

Mabilis ang tugtog niya ng piyesa.
‘His playing of the piece is fast.”

Ang
bilis ng tugtog niya ng piyesa!
Kay

‘How fast he plays the piece!”

It is only in exclamations that nominalized verb bases occur after the marker ng. In all other cases
(construction types (1) and (2) above), nominalized verb bases follow the marker ang.

(Apart from nominalized verb bases, Tagalog also has a great many forms that occur both as verb
bases and as nouns. Thus the base of the verb gumawa ‘make’ occurs as the noun gawa ‘something made"
and the base of the verb magtrabaho ‘(to) work’ occurs as the noun trabaho ‘work’, Nominalized verb bases
are distinguished from nouns that also occur as verb bases in several ways. In the first place, nominalized
verb bases occur only in the few contexts discussed above, while nouns occur in many other contexts as
well. Thus the noun gawa may occur in predicate position, as in Gawa ni Pedro iyon ‘That’s something
Pedro made’ (Literally, ‘That’s Pedro's something made’), while a nominalized verb base may never occur in
this position. Secondly, nominalized verb bases always express a verb-like, or actional meaning, while nouns
that also occur as verb bases generally express an object or product of the activity expressed by the related
verb, as the noun gawa expresses an Object or product of the verb gumawa. There are, however, certain
ambiguous cases in which a form may be interpreted either as a noun or as a nominalized verb base. Thus
the sentence Mabilis ang gawa ni Pedro may mean either ‘Pedro made (something) quickly’ or ‘What Pedro
made is fast’. In the first interpretation, gawa is a nominalized verb base, and alternates freely with the
gerund paggawa; in the second interpretation gawa is a noun.)

§3.28. Nominal clauses.
A clause is a construction that has essentially the same internal structure as a sentence, but that
occurs as part of another sentence. A NOMINAL CLAUSE is a clause that occurs as an expansion of a

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
a
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 169

nominal (a noun or a marker plus a noun): i.e., a clause that occurs in some of the same contexts as those
in which nominals occur in basic sentences. The nominal clauses of Tagalog are discussed below under the
following headings: (1) DIRECT-QUOTATION CLAUSES; (2) INDIRECT-QUOTATION CLAUSES;
(3) OTHER OBJECT CLAUSES; (4) DIRECTIONAL AND CAUSATIVE CLAUSES; (5) PREDICATE
CLAUSES AFTER INVERTED TOPICS. (cf. also the discussion of indefinite nominal clauses in §7.18).

(1) Direct-quotation clauses. A direct-quotation clause is a clause that purports to reproduce some
utterance in exactly the original words. Direct-quotation clauses occur as expansions of one of the
following:

(a) the topic of certain object-focus verbs;

(b) an inverted predicate with certain nominalized object-focus-verb topics;

(c) the object complement with certain actor-focus and directional-focus verbs:
(d) _ the predicate with certain nominal topics.

(a) Direct-quotation clauses occur as topics of object-focus verbs (cf. §5.3) signifying some act of
speech. Unlike the nominals of which they are expansions, the direct-quotation clauses are not preceded by
the marker ang. Some examples are:

Sasabihin )

Sinasabi niya sa akin. “Wala akong pera.”

Sinabi {
fo tell

‘He tells me, “I don’t have any money.” ”
[rota

(cf. Sasabihin niya sa akin ang lahat.
‘He will tell me every thing.’)

Itatanong
Itinatanong niya sa akin, “Bakit hindi mo ako tutulungan?”
Itinanong

{ will ask
‘He asks me, “Why won't you help me?” ’
{asked

(cf. Itatanong niya sa akin ang dahilan.
‘He will ask me the reason.’)

Isisigaw
Isinisigaw niya sa akin, “‘Umuwi ka.”
Isinigaw
will shout
*He shouts at me, “Go home.””’
shouted

(cf. Isisigaw niya sa akin ang utos.
‘He will shout the order at me.’)

(b) Direct-quotation clauses occur as predicates with nominalized object-focus verb topics. The verbs

that occur as nominalized topics with direct-quotation clauses as predicates are the same verbs that occur as
predicates with the clauses as topics (see (a) above). The construction always involves either ay-inversion or

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

170 CHAPTER 3

contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2): that is, the topic is moved to a position before the predicate, and is
followed either by the inversion-marker ay, or by a pause. Thus:

akin ay
Ang sasabihin niya sa “Wala akong pera.”
akin,

‘What he will tell me is, “I don’t have any money.”

akin ay
(cf. Ang sasabihin niya sa kasinungalingan.
akin,

‘What he will tell me is a lic.’)

The inversion, which is optional with a nominal predicate, is obligatory with a nominal-clause predicate.
Sentences with predicate direct-quotation clauses in initial position followed by nominalized object-focus
verb topics do not occur. Thus there is no such sentence as *“‘Iala akong pera”, ang sasabihin niya sa akin
to parallel the occurring sentence Kasinungalingan ang sasabihin niya sa akin.

(c) Direct-quotation clauses occur as object complements of the actor-focus and directional-focus
counterparts of the object-focus verbs discussed under (a): i.e., verbs signifying some act of speech. Unlike
the nominals of which they are expansions, the clauses are not preceded by the marker ag. Some examples
are:

Magsasabi

Nagsasabi siya sa akin, “Wala akong pera.”

Nagsabi
f will tell

‘He tells me, “I don’t have any moncy.”’’
l told

(cf. Magsasabi siya sa akin ng lahat.
‘He will tell me every thing.’)

Sasabihan )
Sinabihan_{ niya ako, “Wala akong pera.”

Sinabihan
will tell

‘He tells me, “I don’t have any money.” ”
told

(cf. Sasabihan niya ako ng lahat.
‘He will tell me every thing.”)

(d) Direct-quotation clauses occur as predicates opposite QUOTATION TAGS in topic position. A
quotation tag consists of a SPEECIT NOUN —i.c., a noun that designates the product of an act of
specch — plus a mg phrase that designates the spcaker(s). The most common speech noun is sabi (literally,
‘something said/told’). (Sabi, like most other speech nouns, also occurs as the base of a set of verbs that
designate the act of which the noun itself designates the product: cf. magsabi/sabihin/sabihan ‘say/tell’.)
Some other speech nouns are: ayon (literally, ‘something said in agreement’), sagot ‘answer’, sigaw
(literally, ‘something shouted’), éanong ‘question’, ufos ‘order’, wika (literally, ‘language’ — a literary or
dialectal alternative to sabi), and yaya ‘invitation’.

In some cases speech nouns are translatable by nouns in English: ¢.g.,

“Saan ka pupunta?” ang tanong niya.
‘His question was, “Where are you going?” ”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 171

“Sa palengke,” ang sagot ko.
‘My answer was, “To the market.”’

In many cases, however, there is no common English noun that is equivalent to the Tagalog noun, and the
normal English translation involves a verb signifying an act of speech:

“Wala akong pera,” ang sabi niya.
“He said, “I don’t have any money.

“Umuwi ka,” ang sigaw niya.
“He shouted, “Go home.” ’

(Even where there is an English noun equivalent in meaning to the Tagalog noun, the Tagalog sentence may
be translated by an English sentence with a speech verb. Thus “‘Saan ka pupunta?"” ang tanong niya may
also be translated, ‘He asked, “Where are you going?” ’)

The usual interpretation of a quotation tag is that the act of speech referred to occurred at some time
in the past: hence the above translations with ‘His question was’, ‘He asked", etc. The tag may, however,
also be used to refer to recurrent or habitual acts of speech if the context makes this meaning clear: e.g.,

“Saan ka pupunta?” ang tanong niya araw-araw.
“Every day he asks, “Where are you going?” ”

The topic marker ang is optionally deletable before a quotation tag. Thus, also:

“Saan ka pupunta?” tanong niya.
“Sa palengke,” sagot ko.

“Wala akong pera,” sabi niya.
“Umuwi ka,” sigaw niya.

A quotation tag may occur in initial position in ay inversion or contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2):

niya’y )
Ang tanong “Saan ka pupunta?”
niya, \
{ ko’y
Ang sagot “Sa palengke.”
l ko,
niya’y
Ang sabi “Wala akong pera.”
niya,
friva’y
Ang sigaw “Umuwi ka.”
(hiya,

In some cases, the topic marker ang is delectable before an inverted quotation tag. Deletion of ang is
especially common before sabi. Thus:

{ niya’y)
Sabi “Wala akong pera.”
{ niya. {

As was noted above, wika (phrase-finally /wi:ka’/, non-phrase-finally /wi:ka:/, with compensatory
lengthening of the final vowel (cf. § 1.12) is a literary or dialectal alternative to sabi. When the topic marker

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
172 CHAPTER 3

ang is deleted before it, wika is in some cases optionally contracted to ‘ka /ka:/ or a f’a:/, The ‘ka
contraction occurs before any ng-form personal pronoun, the @a- contraction before the ng form of a
third-person personal pronoun, or, less, commonly, before ng (spelled nang in this case) plus an unmarked
noun, ni(na) plus a personal noun, or the ng form of a deictic pronoun. Both ‘Ka- and a- are treated as
prefixes in conventional spelling. Thus:

‘kako ‘I said’ ‘kanatin ‘we (I and others) said”
‘kanita ‘you (sg.) and I said* ‘kanamin ‘we (you and I and others) said’
‘kamo “you (sg.) said" ‘kaninyo ‘you (pl.) said’
‘kanya ‘kanila )
} ‘he/she said’ ‘They said’
anya anila {
anang bata “the child said’
ani Pedro ‘Pedro said’
anito “this one said”

Examples in sentences are:

“Umalis ka na.” kako.
‘I said, “Leave now.”’’

‘Kanamin, “Ayaw naming gawin iyon.”
‘We said, “We don’t want to do that.” ”

‘kaniya’y

“Marikit ba siya?”
Aniya’y
‘He said/asked, “Is she pretty?” *

(In addition to being used as quotation tags, the two forms ‘kamo and ‘kaninyo are used as imperatives
meaning “‘Say.”” Thus a sentence like:

‘Kamo, “Umalis ka na.”

is ambiguous, and can mean either ‘You said, “Leave now” ’ or ‘Say, “Leave now.” *)

(2) Indirect-quotation clauses. An indirect-quotation clause is a clause that purports to reproduce the
content of some utterance, but not to reproduce the utterance in its original form. Indirect-quotation
clauses occur as topics opposite certain object-focus verbs, as object complements with certain actor-focus
or directional-focus verbs, and, in some cases, as inverted predicates (see the discussion under (b), below).
Indirect-quotation clauses may be divided into three classes on the basis of their correspondence to certain
underlying sentence types: STATEMENT CLAUSES (corresponding to statements, whose basic structure is
described in Chapter 2); IMPERATIVE CLAUSES (corresponding to imperative sentences — cf. §5.29);
and INTERROGATIVE CLAUSES (corresponding to questions — cf. § §7.3 through 7.12).

Except when they occur in sentence-initial-position (see the discussion under (d), below), or as
inverted predicates (see the discussion under (b)), indirect-quotation clauses are introduced either by the
linker naj/-ng (cf. §3.11) or by the particle Kung. The linker na/-ng is used to introduce both statement
clauses and imperative clauses:

kay Pedrong
Sinabi ko narito ka.
kay Manuel na

{Pedro
‘I told that you are/were here.”

[Manuel

Elements sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 173

kay Pedrong

Iniutos ko tapusin niya ang trabaho.
kay Manuel na
Pedro )

‘L ordered to finish the work.”
Manuel{

(There is often a rhythmic break before a nominal clause, such that the clause constitutes a distinct
intonation phrase (cf. §1.23). When a rhythmic break occurs before a clause introduced by the linker
naj-ng, the break precedes the linker, and the /na/ form of the linker is used, whatever the preceding word.
Thus, also: Sinabi ko kay Pedro na narito ka, etc.)

The particle kung is used to introduce interrogative clauses: ¢.g.,

Itinanong ko sa kanya kung narito ka.
‘lL asked him if you were here.’

Clauses introduced by na/-ng or kung are never preceded by a nominal marker (ang, ng, etc.).
Statement clauses have essentially the same internal structure as statements. Thus:

Sinabi kong maganda si Maria.
‘I said that Maria was beautiful.”

(cf. Maganda si Maria.
‘Maria is beautiful.’)

Sinabi kong nakita kita doon.
‘L said that I saw you there.”

(cf. Nakita kita doon.
‘I saw you there.’)

Imperative clauses have essentially the same internal structure as imperative sentences (e.g., they
always include the basic form of a verb), but, while the actor in an imperative sentence is always expressed

by a second-person pronoun, the actor in an imperative clause may be expressed by nominals of other types
as well. Thus:

ko
mo
Sinabi ng Nanay nakanin < niya ang pagkain.
ng bata
ni Manuel
I
you
‘Mother said that he should eat the food.”
the child
Manuel
(cf. Kanin mo ang pagkain.
‘Eat the food.)
kami.
kayo.
Sinabi ng Nanay na maghintay sila.
ang mga bata.
sina Manuel.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
174 CHAPTER 3

we
you
‘Mother said that they should wait.”
the children
Manuel and his friends

(cf. Maghintay kayo.
‘Wait.’)

When the person who is to perform the action expressed by the imperative clause is specified earlier
in the sentence, the word or phrase expressing the actor within the imperative clause is optionally deletable.
Thus:

Sinabi ng Nanay sa aking kanin (ko) ang pagkain.
‘Mother said to me that [ should cat the food.”
(Or: ‘Mother told me to eat the food.’)

Sinabi ng Nanay sa inyong maghintay (kayo).
‘Mother said to you that you should wait.’
(Or: ‘Mother told you to wait.’)

Interrogative clauses have essentially the same internal structure as questions, except that the enclitic
particle ba (cf. §6.4, subsection (g)), which is optionally present in the questions, is never present in the
clauses. Interrogative clauses may correspond to yes-no questions, information questions, alternative
questions, etc.: e¢.g.,

Itinanong ko kung darating siya.
‘I asked if he was coming.”

(cf. Darating (ba) siya?
‘Is he coming?’)

Itinanong ko kung kailan siya darating.
‘LT asked when he was coming.”

(cf. Kailan (ba) siya darating?
‘When is he coming?’

Itinanong ko kung darating siya, o hindi.
‘L asked whether he was coming or not.”

(cf. Darating (ba) siya, o hindi?
‘Is he coming, or not?’)

Indirect-quotation clauses serve all the same sentence functions as direct-quotation clauses. That is,
they occur as:

(a) topics with certain object-focus verbs;
(b) inverted predicates with certain nominalized object-focus verb topics;
(c) object complements with certain actor-focus and directional-focus verbs;

(d) predicates opposite quotation-tag topics.

(The verbs and nouns that occur opposite indirect-quotation clauses are the same as those that occur
opposite direct-quotation clauses.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 178

(a) A number of examples of indirect-quotation clauses occurring as topics with object-focus verbs
have been included in the preceding discussion. Some further examples are:

Isinagot niyang maaga pa.
‘He replied that it was still early.”

Ipinakiusap niyang pumunta ka.
‘He requested that you go.”

Sinabi ba niya kung bakit hindi siya sumama sa kanila?
‘Did he say why he didn’t go along with them?’

(b) Statement and imperative clauses occurring as inverted predicates opposite nominalized
object-focus verb topics lack the introductory linker na-/ng:

f niya’y
Ang sinagot maaga pa.
niya,

‘What he replied was that it was still carly.”

ng Nanay ay

Ang sinabi maghintay tayo.
ng Nanay,

‘What Mother said was that we should wait.’

Interrogative clauses occurring in this position are, however, introduced by kung:

ko’y )
Ang itinanong kung narito ka.
ko, {

‘What I asked was whether you were here.”

When the actor within the nominalized topic is expressed by something other than a first-person (or
dual) pronoun, the inverted predicate clause frequently includes the enclitic particle daw/raw (‘reportedly’,
‘it is said’ — cf. §6.4 subsection (c)). Thus, also:

Ang sinabi ng Nanay ay maghintay daw tayo.

(The use of daw/raw often resolves a potential ambiguity between an indirect-quotation clause and a
direct-quotation clause. Thus, in speech, Ang sinabi ng Nanay ay maghintay tayo may be confused with
Ang sinabi ng Nanay ay, “Maghintay tayo” “What Mother said was, “Let's wait.” * The inclusion of daw/raw
in the indirect-quotation clause eliminates this ambiguity.) Some further examples of the use of daw in
inverted predicate clauses are:

Ang isinagot niya’y mahirap daw siya.
‘What he replied was that he was poor.”

Ang itinanong ni Ben ay kung sino raw ang bagong titser.
‘What Ben asked is who the new teacher is.’

(c) Examples of indirect-quotation clauses occurring as objects of actor-focus and directional-focus
verbs are:

{sinabihan ko si

Inutusan ko si
“L ordered Manuel to finish the work.”

Nagtanong ako sa iyo)
kung kailan siya darating.

Tinanong kita f

‘L asked you when he was coming.”

(d) When they occur as predicates opposite quotation-tag topics, indirect-quotation clauses are not
introduced by na/-ng or kung. An interrogative clause may include the enclitic particle ba. Examples are:

Sinira ko (raw) ang kamera niya, )
Matulog (daw) sila, ang sabi niya.
Bakit (ba) (raw) ninyo siya tinawag,

that I ruined his camera.”
“He said

that they should go to sleep.’
‘He asked why you called him.”

(Note that sabi may be used with an interrogative clause in the meaning ‘(something) ask(ed)’.) As in the
case of inverted-predicate clauses with nominalized object-focus-verb topics (see (b), above), the predicate
clause with a topic noun often includes the enclitic daw/raw.

Sentences involving predicate indirect-quotation clauses and quotation-tag topics show the same range
of variations as those involving predicate direct-quotation clauses and quotation-tag topics (see above). Thus
the following are all possible, and are more or less identical in meaning:

Matulog (daw) sila, ang sabi niya.
Matulog (daw) sila, sabi niya.

Ang sabi niya’y matulog (daw) sila.
Sabi niya’y matulog (daw) sila.

‘He said that they should go to sleep.”

The same ‘Ka- and a- formations (‘kako, ‘kamo, (‘k Janiya, etc. — see (1.d), above) that occur with
direct-quotation clauses occur with indirect-quotation clauses. In the case of the indirect-quotation clauses,
the ‘ka- and a formations may occur in medial, as well as in initial or final, position. In medial position, the
formations are neither preceded nor followed by pause. They occur immediately after any enclitic particles,
or, if there are no enclitic particles, in the position in which an enclitic particle, if present, would occur.

(3) Other object clauses. Both direct-quotation and indirect-quotation clauses may be classified as
OBJECT CLAUSES, in that they typically serve as expansions of topics opposite object-focus verbs, or as
expansions of object-complements with non-object-focus verbs. The verbs with which direct-quotation and
indirect-quotation clauses occur all signify acts of speech. There are, however, a number of other verbs that
also take object clauses: e.g., verbs of perception such as:

makabalita/mabalitaan ‘hear (news of)’
makakita/makita ‘see’
makapansin/mapansin ‘(happen to) notice’
makaramdam/maramdaman ‘feel’
makarinig/marinig ‘hear’

or verbs signifying mental processes, such as:

humula/hulaan “guess/predict”
makaintindi/maintindihan ‘understand’
makalimot/makalimutan ‘(happen to) forget’
mag-akala/akalain ‘think (mistakenly)’
umisip/isipin ‘think’

(In the above listings, the first verb listed is an actor-focus verb, the second an object-focus verb.)

Object clauses occurring with such verbs are identical in form with indirect-quotation clauses of the
statement and interrogative sub-classes (see above). Thus, as topics or object complements, clauses that
correspond to statements are introduced by the linker na/-ng: e.g.,

{ Pedrong

Nakita ni puno na ang bus.

Manuel na

‘Pedro

saw that the bus was already full.’
‘Manuel (

(cf. Puno na ang bus.
‘The bus is already full.’)

Siya ang nakakitang puno na ang bus.
‘He’s the one who saw that the bus was already full.”

As inverted predicates, clauses that correspond to statements lack an introductory linker: ¢.g.,

Pedro’y
Ang nakita ni puno na ang bus.
Pedro,

“What Pedro saw was that the bus was already full.”
Clauses that correspond to questions are introduced by the particle kung in all cases:

Nakita ni Pedro kung sinu-sino ang nasa bus.
‘Pedro saw who was in the bus.’

(cf. Sinu-sino ang nasa bus?
‘Who is in the bus?’)

Siya ang nakakita kung sinu-sino ang nasa bus.
‘He’s the one who saw who was in the bus.”

Pedro'y

Ang nakita ni kung sinu-sino ang nasa bus.

Pedro, {
“What Pedro saw was who was in the bus.’

Like direct- and indirect-quotation clauses, object clauses with verbs of perception and verbs signifying
mental processes occur as: (a) topics, (b) inverted predicates, (c) object complements. Some further
examples are:

(a) Napansin niyang umiiyak ang bata.
‘He noticed that the child was crying.’

Nakalimutan niya kung dapat siyang maghintay, o hindi.
‘He forgot whether he was supposed to wait or not.’

Inakala niyang paparoon ka.
‘He though (mistakenly) that you would be there.’

(b)

\ ko'y}

Ang narinig mabuti ang klima roon.
ko,

‘What I heard is that the climate there is good.’

{key )

Ang nabalitaan ( kung bakit hindi sila dumating.

‘What I heard (news of) is why they didn’t come.’

j ko'y |
Ang inisip ikaw ang panganay.

(ko, |

‘What I thought was that you were the eldest child.”

(c) Siya ang nakaramdam na masyadong maliit ang bahay.
*He’s the one who felt that the house was too small.’

Siya ang humula kung ano ang regalo.
“*He’s the one who guessed what the present was.”

Siya ang nakaintinding kailangan silang magpahinga.
‘He’s the one who understood that they needed to rest.’

There are at least three nouns that signify products of mental processes, which occur in sentences
with nominal clauses: isip ‘(a) thought’, akala ‘(a mistaken) thought’, and alam ‘something known’. The
clauses that occur with these nouns may conveniently be classified as object clauses.

Jsip and akala occur as inverted topics opposite nominal-clause predicates. (The inversion is
obligatory.) Only statement clauses occur, and, like other statement-clause predicates, they lack a preceding
linker: ¢.g.,

 

oits d'auteur
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 179

{ ko’y }

Ang isip
(ro, {
maaga pa.

ko’y
Ang akala

ko,

thought

I that it was still early.’

thought (mistakenly)
(More literally: ‘My thought was that it was still early.’)

Ang is optionally deletable before isip and akala. Thus, also:
Isip ko’y maaga pa.

etc,

Alam may occur in the same contexts as isip and akala — i.e., as an inverted topic, with optional
deletion of ang , before a statement-clause predicate: e.g.,

(Ang) alam ko'y

maaga pa.
(Ang) alam ko,
“[ know that it is still early.’

Alam, however, may also occur as predicate before either a statement clause introduced by na/-ng or an
interrogative clause introduced by Kung: ¢.g.,

Alam kong maaga pa.
‘L know that it is still early.’
(‘That it is still early is something known by me.’)

Alam ko kung kailan siya darating.
‘I know when he is coming.’

(cf. §7.16 for a discussion of aywan, the negative counterpart of alam.)

(4) Directional and causative clauses, As was noted above, object clauses are clauses that typically
serve as topics of object-focus verbs or as object complements (i.e., expansions of ng phrases). In addition
to such clauses, there are several types of clauses that are similar in form to object clauses (of the types
dealt with under (3), above), but that differ from them in sentence function.

DIRECTIONAL CLAUSES are clauses used as topics of directional-focus verbs, as inverted predicates

opposite nominalized directional-focus topics, or as directional complements (i.c., expansions of sa
phrases). There are only a few verbs that occur with directional clauses: c¢.g.,

magpasya/pagpasyahan ‘decide’
maniwala/paniwalaan ‘believe’
umawa/asahan ‘hope’

(In the above list, the first verb listed in each case is actor-focus, the second directional-focus.) Directional
clauses show the same range of forms as object clauses: i.e., as topics and complements they are introduced
by the linker na/-ng if they correspond to statements, by kung if they correspond to questions: ¢.g.,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
180 CHAPTER 3

Pinagpasyahan niyang uuwi sila.
‘He decided that they would go home.”

(cf. Pinagpasyahan niya ang gawain.
‘He decided (upon) the activity.”)

Nagpasya siyang uuwi sila.
‘He decided that they would go home.”

(cf. Nagpasya siya sa gawain.
‘He decided (upon) the activity.’)

Pinagpasyahan niya
kung saan sila pupunta.

Nagpasya siya
‘He decided where they would go.”

As inverted predicates, statement clauses lack the introductory linker, while interrogative clauses are, once
more, introduced by kung: c.g.,

(riya'y)
Ang pinagpasyan uuwi sila.
niya,
‘What he decided was that they would go home."
niya’y )
Ang pinagpasyahan kung saan sila pupunta.
niya,

‘What he decided was where they would go.’

CAUSATIVE CLAUSES are clauses that occur as topics of causative-focus verbs (cf. §5.8), as inverted
predicates opposite nominalized causative-focus verbs, and as expansions of causative adverbs (i.c., adverbs
introduced by dahil sa — cf. §6.11, subsection (1.b)) after intransitive verbs. Some verbs that occur with
causative clauses are:

magalak/ikagalak ‘be pleased (about/that)’
magulat/ikagulat ‘be surprised (about/that)’
mainis/ikainis ‘be annoyed (about/that)’
malugod/ikalugod ‘be happy (about/that)’
malungkot/ikalungkot ‘be unhappy (about/that)’
matakot/ikatakot ‘be afraid (about/that)’
matuwa/ikatuwa ‘be happy (about/that)’

(In the above list, the first verb listed in each case is intransitive, the second causative—focus.) Causative
clauses always correspond to statements. When they occur as topics or as expansions of causative adverbs,
they are introduced by the linker na/-ng; when they occur as inverted predicates, there is no introductory
linker. Some examples are:

Ikinatuwa kong naroon ka.
‘I was happy that you were there.’

(cf. Ikinatuwa ko iyon.
‘I was happy about that.’)

 
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 18k
Natuwa akong naroon ka.
‘I was happy that you were there.”

(cf. Natuwa ako dahil doon.
‘I was happy about that.’)

{ ko'y)

Ang ikinatuwa naroon ka.
(ko. f
‘What I was happy about was that you were there.”
(cf. ko'y)
Ang ikinatuwa iyon.
ko,

‘What I was happy about was that.")

(It may be noted that the nominal clause after an intransitive verb is similar in meaning to an adverbial
clause introduced by dahil, etc. (cf. §6.16). Thus, also, Natuwa ako dahil naroon ka ‘I was happy because
you were there’. The nominal clause is so identified because of its form, which is identical with that of the
topic clause that occurs with the corresponding causative-focus verb. It may also be noted that many of the
intransitive verbs that accept causative clauses are homonymous with directional verbs. Thus maniwa also
occurs as a directional verb meaning ‘be amused at’. I¢ is clear, however, that when there is a following
nominal clause, it is the intransitive, rather than the directional, verb that is being used. This is evident not
only from the meaning — see the second example above — but also from the fact that the directional-focus
counterpart of the directional verb does not accept a clause as topic. Thus Kafuwaan, the directional-focus
counterpart of matuwa ‘be amused at’, never occurs with a topic nominal clause.)

(5) Predicate clauses after inverted topics, Many constructions involving nominal clauses used as
predicates after inverted topics are presented above. In most of the cases presented, the same elements that
occur as inverted topics opposite nominal-clause predicates also occur as predicates opposite nominal-clause
topics. For example, verbal constructions that signify acts of speech may oocur cither as inverted topics or
as predicates opposite indirect-quotation clauses: e.g.,

niya’y )

Ang sinabi wala (raw) siyang pera.
niya,

‘What he said was that he doesn’t have any money.”

Sinabi niyang wala siyang pera.
‘He said he doesn’t have any money."

In addition to those elements that may occur either as inverted topics with nominal-clause predicates
or as predicates with nominal-clause topics, there are certain elements that serve only the former of these
functions. Some examples have already been given: e.g., quotation tags formed with speech nouns such as
sabi (literally ‘something said’), which occur freely as inverted topic before an indisect-quotation clause
predicate, as in:

niya'y

Ang sabi wala (raw) siyang pera.
niya,

‘What he said was that he doesn’t have any moncy.”

but which never occur as predicate with an indirect-quotation clause topic. (There is no *Sabi niyang wala
siyang pera.) There are, however, a number of other elements that share this characteristic (but not the
other characteristics of quotation tabs, and which have not thus far been discussed. These elements include

Elements sous droits d'auteur
182 CHAPTER 3

any nominal or (nominalized) adjectival whose meaning is such that it may be identified with what is
expressed by a clause: e.g.,

Nominals: karaingan ‘complaint’
katotohanan ‘truth’
dahilan “cause”
palagay ‘opinion’
pasya ‘decision’
problema ‘problem’
suliranin ‘problem’

Adjectivals: kahiya-hiya ‘shameful’
interesante ‘interesting’
mabuti “good
masagwa ‘disagreeable’
masama ‘bad’
nakakagulat ‘surprising’
nakakainis ‘annoying’

They also include a few (nominalized) verbals that contain directional-focus ka. . . -an verbs (cf. §5.4), such
as:

kagulatan “be surprised at”
katakutan ‘be afraid of
katuwaan ‘be amused at”

Predicate clauses occurring after inverted topics such as these show the same formal features as
previously-presented sentence-initial clauses: that is, clauses that correspond to statements lack any
introductory linker or particle, while clauses that correspond to questions are introduced by the particle
kung. Some examples are:

niya’y
Ang karaingan wala siyang pera.
hiya,
‘His complaint is that he doesn't have any money.’
kahiya-hiya'y)
Ang hindi nila siya tinutulungan.
kahiya-hiya,

‘What is shameful is that they don’t help him.’

j interesante'y)
Ang kung sinu-sino ang inanyayahan nila.

‘What is interesting is whom they invited.’

‘What I'm surprised at is that he left early.’

Ang kinatutuwaan { kung paano niya nagawa.

‘What I’m amused at is how he managed to do it.”

§3.29.Enclitic personal pronouns.

The present section is concerned with certain peculiarities shown by personal pronouns, as compared
with nominals of other types, with respect to the positions they occupy in sentences, (The forms and
meanings of the personal pronouns are presented in §3.3.)

As was noted in §2.15, the order of non-initial components of basic sentences is in most cases not
fixed. Thus, for example, a sentence topic and an actor complement may, in general, occur in either
order: ¢.g.,

{ai si Ben ni som
Nakita ni Pedro si Ben.
‘Pedro saw Ben.’

(In both sentences si Ben is the topic, ni Pedro the actor complement.) This same flexibility of word order
is not found in the case of sentences (either basic or derived) whose topic is the ang form of a personal
pronoun. For example, while the following sentence is grammatical —

Nakita siya ni Pedro.
‘Pedro saw him.’

— there is no such sentence as:
*Nakita ni Pedro siya.

Nor is the same flexibility present in the case of sentences that include the ng form of a personal pronoun
used as an actor complement. Thus there is a grammatical sentence:

Nakita niya si Ben.
‘He saw Ben.

but there is no:

*Nakita si Ben niya.

This difference in behavior between personal pronouns and nominals of other types reflects the fact that
the pronouns are, in certain of their uses, ENCLITICS (or ENCLITIC WORDS).

An enclitic is a word that obligatorily occurs in a position after some other word or group of words.
In Tagalog, enclitics, with certain statable exceptions, follow the first word of the construction of which
they constitute an immediate part. (See below for an explanation of IMMEDIATE PART.) Note, for
example, the position of the enclitic pronoun siya in the following sentences:

(1) Masaya siya ngayon.
‘He is happy today.”

(cf. Masaya si Ben ngayon.
‘Ben is happy today.’)

(2) Hindi siya masaya ngayon.
‘He isn’t happy today.’

(cf. Hindi masaya si Ben ngayon.
‘Ben isn’t happy today.")

(3) Bakit siya hindi masaya ngayon?
‘Why isn’t he happy today?’

(cf. Bakit hindi masaya si Ben ngayon?
‘Why isn’t Ben happy today?’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
184 CHAPTER 3

Siya — which is, in these examples, an immediate part of the entire sentence — occurs after the first word of
the sentence in each case, whatever the grammatical function of this word. (In sentence (1), a basic
sentence, the first word is a predicate adjective; in sentence (2), the first word is a negator — cf. §7.13; in
sentence (3), the first word is an interrogative — cf. §7.10.) This behavior is notably different from that of
a non-enclitic nominal (such as si Ber).

Tagalog has enclitic words of two types: enclitic personal pronouns and enclitic particles. The
enclitic personal pronouns are discussed in the present section, the enclitic particles in § §6.2 through 6.6.

The sa forms of personal pronouns are never enclitic. The ang forms of personal pronouns (hereafter,
ang pronouns) are enclitic when they are used as topics, except that ang pronouns used as inverted topics

(cf. §7.2) are non-enclitic. The 2g forms of personal pronouns (hereafter, ng pronouns) are enclitic both as
actor complements and as possessive modifiers (cf. §3.20), as in:

Hindi niya kaklase si Ben.
“Ben isn’t his classmate.’

(cf. Hindi kaklase ni Pedro si Ben.
“Ben isn’t Pedro's classmate.’)

(The composite pronoun kita —cf. §3.3 —is also enclitic.) (Topic ang phrases other than personal
pronouns occasionally occur in typically enclitic positions. The placement of such a topic in enclitic
position is always optional. Optional enclitic behavior may be manifested by non-personal-pronoun topics
in, for example, sentences introduced by mayroon, hindi, or wala (cf. §§4.22, 7.13, and 7.14), and in
sentences with modification constructions in predicate position. Examples are:

Mayroon ba ang batang lapis?
‘Does the child have a pencil?’
(cf. Mayroon bang lapis ang bata?)

Hindi si Juan darating bukas.
‘Juan won’t be coming tomorrow.”
(cf. Hindi darating bukas si Juan.)

Wala itong takip.
‘This one doesn't have a cover.”
(cf. Walang takip ito.)

Magaling ang aspirinang gamot.
‘Aspirin is an excellent medicine.’
(cf. Magaling na gamot ang aspirina.)

Optional enclitic behavior may also occasionally be manifested by non-personal-pronoun topics in
constructions of various other types.)

When a sentence includes an ang pronoun and a ng pronoun both of which are enclitic to the same
word, the following rules of order obtain:

(1) the monosyllabic pronouns ka (ang form, second-person singular), ko (ng form, first-person
singular), and mo (ng form, second-person singular) always precede any other enclitic pronoun;

(2) in other cases, an ang pronoun and a mg pronoun may occur in either order, but the order
ng-pronoun-plusang-pronoun is the more common, especially when the ng pronoun is niya (third-person
singular). Examples of the operation of these rules are:

niya.
Nakita ka namin.

186 CHAPTER 3

(The first order is the more common in each of the last three examples.) (For a discussion of the order of
enclitic pronouns in relation to enclitic particles, cf. §6.2.)

As was noted above, enclitics, with certain statable exceptions, follow the first word of the construction of
which they constitute an immediate part. For purposes of describing enclitic behavior, enclitic ang
pronouns may be said to constitute an immediate part cither of a sentence or of a clause. (A clause is a part
of a sentence which itself has essentially the same internal structure — predicate-plus-topic — as a sentence.)
In basic sentences (and derived sentences that contain only one clause), an enclitic ang pronoun normally
follows the first word of the sentence. In sentences that include two or more clauses, however, an ang
pronoun occurring as topic of a non-initial clause normally follows the first word of the clause, not the first
word of the sentence. Thus in the sentence:

Nang dumating si Ben, hindi siya nakita ni Pedro.
‘When Ben came, Pedro didn’t see him.’

siya follows hindi, the first word of the clause of which it is the topic; it cannot be moved to a position
within the preceding clause.

For purposes of describing enclitic behavior, an enclitic ng pronoun may be said to constitute an
immediate past either of a predicate or of a MARKED CONSTRUCTION (a construction preceded by one
of the markers ang, ng, or sa). When a ng pronoun occurs as actor complement within a verbal predicate or
possessive modifier within a nominal predicate, it normally follows the first word of this predicate. The
predicate itself may occur at the beginning of a sentence, at the beginning of a non-initial clause, or, in
certain inversion constructions (cf. §7.2), it may follow the topic (plus, in some cases, the inversion marker
ay). Note the position of niya in the following sentences.

()) nakita
Hindi niya si Ben.
kaklase

‘He didn’t see Ben.’
‘Ben isn’t/wasn’t his classmate.’

(2) nakita
Nang dumating si Pedro, hindi niya si Ben.
kaklase
he didn’t see Ben.”

‘When Pedro came,
Ben wasn’t his classmate.”

(3) { nakita.
Si Ben ay hindi niya
l kaklase.
{He didn’t see Ben.” \
“Ben isn’t/wasn’t his classmate.”

In each sentence, niya follows hindi, which is the first word of the predicate. In sentence (1) the predicate
is sentence-initial; in sentence (2) it is clause-initial; in sentence (3) it follows the topic (and the inversion
marker ay). Regardless of where the predicate occurs, the ng pronoun that constitutes an immediate part of
the predicate follows its first word.

A ng pronoun that occurs as part of a marked construction normally follows the first word, other
than the marker itself, within that construction. The marked construction may involve either a noun and a
ng pronoun used as a possessive modifier, or a verb and ang pronoun used as an actor complement. (Verbs
occur after markers in nominalized verbals — cf. §3.24.) Note, for example, the position of niya in the
following sentences.

who isn’t his classmate \
(3) nakita.
Ibinigay ko iyon sa hindi niya
kaklase.
( he didn’t see.” )

‘I gave that to the one
[wno isn’t his classmate.'{

In each case niya follows hindi, which is the first word that follows the marker (ang, ng, and sa in sentences
(1), (2), and (3), respectively).

The word that an enclitic follows (either immediately or after one or more other enclitics) within a
given construction may be called the PRE-ENCLITIC WORD (hereafter, P). In sentences cited thus far, P
has in cach case been the first word of the construction of which the enclitic constitutes an immediate part.
There are, however, cases in which P is preceded by one or more other words. Any word that precedes P in
a given construction is a NON-PRE-ENCLITIC (hereafter, N). An inventory of common words, word
classes, and structures that function as N with respect to enclitic pronouns is given below. (The inventory
does not apply in all cases to enclitic particles, since certain sentence elements that function as N with
respect to enclitic pronouns may function as P with respect to the particles —cf. §6.6.) From this
inventory the position of P (with respect to pronouns) in any given construction may be determined, since
P is always the first word of the construction that is not N.

The inventory is divided into two parts. Part I, labeled OBLIGATORY NON-PRE-ENCLITICS, lists
sentence elements that never function as P with respect to enclitic pronouns. Part II, labeled OPTIONAL
NON-PRE-ENCLITICS, lists sentence elements that may function either as N or as P with respect to enclitic
pronouns.

(1) Obligatory Non-pre-enclitics
(A) The following words:
(1) The nominal markers ang, Kay, kina, ni, nina, ng, sa, si, sina
(2) The plural marker mga (cf. §3.9)
(3) The inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2)
(4) The locative-phrase marker sa/sa) (cf. § 4.19)
(5) The possessive-, indefinite-, and existential-phrase marker may (cf. §§4.22 and 4.23)
(The possessive/indefinite/existential marker mayroon, however, is not N. Thus:

May pera siya. vs. Mayroon siyang pera.
‘He has money.’ ‘He has money.”

See I.D. below, for an explanation of the -ng after siya in the second sentence.)

Intensive adjectival constructions of the shape adjective-linker-(repeated-)adjective (cf.
84.12): e.g., the first mabait of mabait na mabait ‘very kind’
Gerund-linker-(repeated-)gerund time adverbs (cf. §6.8, subsection (3)): ¢.g., the first
pagkarating of pagkarating na pagkarating ‘as soon as . . . had arrived’

Coordinate phrases (cf. §7.19): ¢.g., mabuti and malakas in mabuti, malakas, at masaya
‘well, strong, and happy*

Adverbial phrases and directional complements that begin the construction of which the
enclitic pronoun is an immediate part, and that are not linked to this construction by the
linker naj-ng. Thus the italicized portions of the following sentences are N with respect to
enclitic pronouns:

Bukas ng gabi nang alas otso siya aalis.
‘IU’s tomorrow night at cight that he's leaving.’

Sa maliit na bahay sa probinsya siya pupunta.
‘It’s the little house in the provinces that he’s going to.’

The following types of expressions that include numbers: (a) grade-level expressions that
include numbers of English origin (cf. §4.4, subsection (3)); (b) age expressions (cf.
§4.4, subsection (4.a)); (c) money expressions that include numbers of Spanish origin, or
that include numbers of Tagalog origin followed by piso (cf. §4.4, subsection (4.b));
(d) combined quantity and price expressions (cf. §4.4, subsection (4.b)). Thus the
italicized portions of the following sentences are N with respect to enclitic pronouns:

(a) Fourth year siya sa unibersidad.
‘He’s (in the) fourth year at the university.’

(b) Isang taon at apat na buwan siya.
‘He is one year and four months old.’

{dos siyentos pesos |
(c) siya.
l Dalawang daang piso

‘He (e.g., a dog) costs two hundred pesos.”

(d) = Dalawa-sandaang-piso sila.
(They are two for a hundred pesos.”

Recipient-topic constructions (cf. §4.5, subsection (a)) that consist of a distributive
numeral followed by the linker na/-ng plus a nominal representing what is to be
distributed. Thus the italicized portion of the following sentence is N with respect to
enclitic pronouns:
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 189

Tigi-tigisang kendi sila.
‘Each of them is to get one candy.”

(C) Adverbs that begin the construction of which the enclitic pronoun is an immediate part, and
that are followed by a pause or by the inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2). Thus the italicized
portions of the following sentences are N with respect to enclitic pronouns.

Bukas ay aalis siya.
‘He'll leave tomorrow.”

Bukas, aalis siya.
‘Tomorrow, he’ll leave.”

Bukas ng gabi ay aalis siya.
‘He'll leave tomorrow night.’

Bukas ng gabi, aalis siya.
‘Tomorrow night, he'll leave.’

(Ay is N per 1.A.3.)

(D) The linkers -ng and na/-ng (As is explained in § §3.8 and 3.11, both the linker -ng and the
linker na/-ng are in some cases manifested as a word-final /n/. For example, in:

Mayroong pera si Juan.
‘Juan has money.”

the linker -ng is manifested as an /n/ replacing the final {n/ of mayroon. For purposes of
determining the position of P, however, the linker is treated as a separable element in all cases.
The word to which the linker would attach were no enclitics present may serve — and
frequently does serve — as P: e.g.,

Mayroon siyang pera.
‘He has money.”

In such cases, the appropriate form of the linker follows the enclitic (or the last of two or more
enclitics), and the word to which the linker would otherwise attach appears in its normal
non-phrase-final form.)

QI) Optional Non-pre-enclitics
(A) The following words:
(1) The resemblance-phrase markers gaya, mukha, and para (cf. §4.18): ¢.g.,

ni Pedro siya.
Gaya

siya ni Pedro.
‘He is like Pedro.”

{Parang si Pedro aot

Para siyang si Pedro.
‘He is like Pedro.’

CHAPTER 3

ee Amerikano sire
Mukha siyang Amerikano.
“He looks like an American.’

(2) The partisanship-phrase marker para (cf. §4.20): e.g.,

fray Makapagal siya.
Para

lsiya kay Makapagal.
‘He is for Makapagal.’

(3) The source-phrase markers buhat and galing (cf. §4.20): e.g.,

Buhat

sa Maynila siya.
Galing
Buhat

siya sa Maynila.
Galing

‘He is from Manila.”

(When a phrase introduced by buhat appears in an inverted adverbial phrase, however,
buhat is always N with respect to enclitic pronouns. Thus:

Buhat sa Maynila siya maglalakad. ‘He will walk from Manila.”
never:
*Buhat siya sa Maynila maglalakad.
This is because, as was noted under I[.B.6, non-final components of inverted adverbial
phrases not linked to what follows them by the linker na/-ng are always N with respect to
enclitic pronouns. This same reservation applies in the case of non-final components of
modification constructions, dealt with under I1.B.1, below.)
(4) The relative-location phrase markers paharap and patalikod (cf. §4.20): ¢.g.,
( sa akin siya. )
Paharap ,
siya sa akin. j
‘He is facing me.”
(sa ilog sila.
Patalikod

sila sa ilog.
‘They have their backs to the river.

(Pararap and patalikod are never N with respect to the monosyllabic pronoun ka. Thus:
Paharap ka sa akin. ‘You are facing me.”
never:

*Paharap sa akin ka.

NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 191

The treatment of paharap and patalikod as P is preferred in other cases, but the treatment
of them as N is also possible.)
(S) The interrogative word bakit ‘why’ (cf. §7.10): c.g.,

{tinanong mo siya? )
Bakit

{mo siya tinanong? {
“Why did you ask him?’

(Other interrogative words are never N. Thus:

Kailan mo siya tinanong?
‘When did you ask him?’

never:
*Kailan tinanong mo siya?)
(6) The adverbs baka ‘maybe’ and fila ‘it seems’: ¢.g.,

aalis siya
Baka ngayon.
siya aalis f

‘Maybe he'll leave today.”

nagustuhan niya

Tila ang bahay.
niya nagustuhan

‘It seems he liked the house.’

(7) Certain subordinating and coordinating conjunctions (cf. § §6.]4 through 6.18 and 7.19).
About half of these are conjunctions of Spanish origin: e.g., dmbis (Spanish en vez)
‘instead,’ (sa) lugar ‘instead,’ miyentras ‘while,’ para ‘so that,’ porke ‘because.’
Non-Spanish conjunctions belonging to this class are: (ar}saka ‘and then,’ (ka jpag(ka)
‘iffwhen,’ haba ‘while,’ matapos ‘after,’ pagkatapos ‘after,’ (sa) halip ‘instead,’ samantala
‘while,’ and tuwi ‘every time (that)' Some examples are:

naaalaala ko
(Ka)pag(ka) iyon, napapatawa ako.
ko naaalaala

‘When I remember that, I feel like laughing.”

j na tulungan niya ako
Sa halip lumabas siya.

l niya akong tulungan

‘Instead of helping me, he went outside.’ (Most conjunctions other than those listed
here are obligatorily N— see class 1.4.8, above. There arc, however, at least two
conjunctions, bago ‘before’ and kundi (a contraction of Aung hindi) ‘if not,’ that are
never N. Thus:

Bago kayo umalis, hugasan mo ang mga pinggan.
“Before you leave, wash the dishes.’

CHAPTER 3

Kundi ko siya nakita, nakaalis sana siya.
‘If Thandn‘t seen him, he would have left,”

never:

*Bago umalis kayo...
*Kundi nakita ko siya...

(8) Distributive numerals in the recipient-topic construction (cf. §4.5, subsection (a)), when
followed by the linker na/-ng plus a noun representing a unit of measurement: e.g.,

Tigi-tigisang piraso(ng Kendi) sila.
Tigi-tigisa silang piraso(ng kendi).
‘They are each to get one piece (of candy).”

(When a distributive numeral in a recipient topic construction is immediately followed by

the linker na/-ng plus a noun representing what is to be distributed, it is obligatorily
N - cf. 1.B.8, above.)

(B) Non-final components of structures of the following types:
(1) Modification constructions (cf. § §3.11-3.17): e.g.,

{ Bagong baro ko )
jyon,
| Bago kong baro {

‘That's my new dress.”

Barong binili ko)
iyon.

Baro kong biniti

‘That’s a dress that I bought.”

Bagong barong binili ko

Bagong baro kong binili iyon.
Bago kong barong binili

‘That's a new dress that I bought."

(The second sentence of the second pair is ambiguous, and may also mean ‘That's my new
dress that someone bought.’ This is because ko may be interpreted in the sentence either
as an actor complement or as a possessive modifier. For the same reason, both the second
and third sentences of the third set are ambiguous: they may also mean ‘That’s my new
dress that someone bought.”)

Na titser siya.)
Mahusay

l siyang tilser. {
‘He’s a good teacher.’

na bantog siya}
Duktor
siyang bantog. \
‘He’s a famous doctor.’

{Pareng Amerikano siya
0 Philipino?

Pare siyang Amerikano

‘Is he an American priest, or a Filipino (priest)?’
NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 193

(When, as in the last two pairs of sentences, the initial-component of the modification
construction is a noun, there is a preference for treating it as N with respect to enclitic

ang pronouns. This is particularly so when, as in the last pair of sentences, the final
component of the construction is also a noun.)

(2) Certain adjective-plus-complement constructions (cf. §4.17): specifically, adjective-plus-
{para)-sa-phrase and adjective-plussa-phrase constructions: ¢.g.,

Bagay siya (para) sa iyo.
‘He is suitable for you.”

{ney (para) sa iyo “yay

{fakot sa kulog ‘vat

Takot siya sa kulog.
‘He is afraid of thunder.’

(The adjective in such constructions is never N with respect to ka. Thus:

Bagay ka (para) sa kaniya.
‘You are suitable for him.’

never:

*Bagay (para) sa kaniya ka.

The treatment of the adjective as P is preferred in other cases, but the treatment of them
as N is also possible.)

(C) One-word adverbs, and both final and non-final components of adverbial phrases, that begin the

construction of which the enclitic pronoun is an immediate part, and that are linked to this
construction by the linker na/-ng. Thus:

na naririnig ko

Madalas yon.
kong naririnig

‘I’ve often heard that.”

Lalong hindi siya

nakagawa ng trabaho.
Lalo siyang hindi
‘He was all the more unable to do any work.”

Ganito(ng) kabilis na naglalakad siya

Ganito(ng) kabilis siyang naglalakad sa iskwela.
Ganito siya(ng) kabilis na naglalakad

“He walks to school as fast as this.’

Parang batang umiiyak siya.
Parang bata siyang umiiyak.
Para siyang batang umiiyak.
“He is crying like a child.”

Adjectivals and Their Expansions
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 195

§4.1 Introduction.

The many different classes of adjectivals that occur in Tagalog may conveniently be divided into two
main groups: ADJECTIVES and ADJECTIVE PHRASES (cf. §2.5). The assignment of a class of
adjectivals to one or the other of these groups is, in general, based upon whether the members of the class
are single words (adjectives) or sequences of two or more words (adjective phrases). (In cases where a class
of adjectivals includes both single words and sequences of two or more words, however, the entire class is

assigned to one or the other group. Thus, both isa ‘one’ and sandaa’t isa ‘one hundred one’ are assigned to
the adjective class, CARDINAL NUMBERS, while both maroon ‘there’ and nasa bahay ‘in the house’ are
assigned to the adjective-phrase class, LOCATIVE ADJECTIVE PHRASES.)

Adjectives and adjective phrases have certain sentence functions in common. Most adjectives and
adjective phrases may serve as:

a. predicates of basic sentences (cf. §2.5):

Mahal
ang bahay.

Nasa probinsya

expensive.’
‘The house is

in the provinces.”

b. — modifiers (cf. §3.11, ff.)

bahay na mahal}
{ mahal na bahay.
Binili niya ang
bahay na nasa eee
{ nasa probinsyang bahay.
expensive house.’
‘He bought the

house in the provinces.’

c. nominalized topics, complements, etc. (cf. §3.24)

mahal.
Binili niya ang

nasa probinsya.

expensive one.”
‘He bought the
one in the provinces.”
mahal.
Bumili siya ng
nasa probinsya.
an expensive one.”
‘He bought
one in the provinces.”

There are also sentence functions peculiar to certain classes or subclasses of adjectives, and others
peculiar to certain classes or subclasses of adjective phrases. Thus only certain unaffixed adjectives and
adjectives formed with the prefixes ma- and nakaka- occur as predicates of sentences with nominalized basic
forms as topics (cf. §3.25): ¢.g.,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
196 CHAPTER 4

Bawal
Magugol ang magsugal.

Nakakawili
prohibited.”

‘Gambling is expensive.”
entertaining.”

And only phrases introduced by nasa or para sa occur as modifiers with optional deletion of the linker
naj-ng (plus, in the case of nasa phrases, deletion of the na- of nasa — cf. §3.14): ¢.g.,

(na) para sa ikalawang grado?
Sino ang titser

(na na)sa silid na iyon?

for the second grade?’
‘Who is the teacher

in that room?"

Most of the sentence functions peculiar to certain classes or subclasses of adjectivals are presented below, in
connection with the presentation of the various adjectival types themselves.

The present chapter is arranged as follows. Various types of adjective formations are presented in
§§4.2 through 4.10: unaffixed adjectives (4.2); ma- adjectives (4.3); cardinal and ordinal numbers (4.4);
other numerical expressions (4.5); attention-directing deictics (4.6); pa- adjectives (4.7); pang- adjectives
(4.8); adjectives expressing inclination (4.9), other derived adjective formations (4.10). Constructions
involving expansions of adjectives are presented in § §4.1! through 4.17: pluralization of adjectives (4.11);
intensification of adjectives (4.12); moderation of adjectives (4.13); comparison of equality (4.14);
comparison of inequality (4.15); superlatives (4.16); adjective-plus-complement constructions (4.17).
Adjective phrases are presented in § §4.]8 through 4.23: phrases expyessing similarity (4.18); locative
adjective phrases (4.19); other relational phrases (4.20); pseudo-verb phrases (4.21); possessive sa and may
phrases (4.22); indefinite and existential may phrases (4.23). Exclamatory sentences, which are derived
from sentences with adjectival predicates, are presented in §4.24.

§4.2. Unaffixed adjectives.

Most of the commonest adjectives of Tagalog are either UNAFFIXED ADJECTIVES or ma-
ADJECTIVES. Unaffixed adjectives, as the label suggests, include no prefixes or suffixes in their formation.
They fall into two major subclasses. The first of these subclasses consists of unaffixed adjectives that lack
inherently long vowels (cf. §1.12), and that are related to nouns and/or verb bases with an inherently long
vowel in the penultimate syllable. (Except for vowel length, the adjectives and the nouns or verb bases are
identical.) Some examples are:

Adjective Noun and/or Verb Base
ayos fayos/ ‘arranged’ Paryos} ‘arrange(ment)’
bali {oali’/ ‘fractured’ foali'/ ‘fracture’
basag {basag/ ‘broken’ foarsag! “break’
buhay /ouhay/ ‘living’ fourhay/ ‘life’
butas /outas/ ‘having a hole’ f{bu'tas/ ‘hole’
bungi Jbuni’/ ‘gap-toothed’ {ourni’! ‘gap in the teeth’
galit /galit/ ‘angry" fga'lit/ ‘anger’
gamit /gamit} ‘used’ {gamit} ‘use’
gutom Jgutom/ ‘hungry’ fgu'tom/ ‘hunger’
hilo fhiloh/ ‘dizzy’ fhirloh{ ‘dizziness’
hukay fhukay/ ‘dug’ fhurkay/ ‘pit’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 197

Adjective Noun and/ae Verb Bast
punit /punit/ ‘torn’ {purnit/ ‘tear’
pagod /pagod/ ‘tired’ {pa‘god/ ‘tiredness’
putol {putol/ ‘cut? {pu-tol/ ‘cut’
sira {sira’/ ‘damaged’ {sira’} ‘damage’
sunog /sunog/ ‘burned’ {suvnog/ ‘fire’
tulis ftulis/ ‘pointed’ {tw lis/ ‘point’
tulog /tulog/ ‘asleep* {ww 'log/ ‘sleep’
uka Puka’f ‘pitted’ furka’} “pit”

(It may be noted that many of the adjectives related to verb bases are translated by past participles in
English: ayos ‘arranged’, bali ‘fractured’, basag ‘broken’, etc.)

All other unaffixed adjectives belong to the second of the major subclasses. The members of this
subclass may or may not include an inherently long vowel. Those that lack inherent length are, in any case,
not related to nouns and/or verb bases with inherent length. Some examples of adjectives in the second
major subclass are:

banal ‘virtuous’ pisa ‘crushed’
berde ‘green’ pula ‘red’
bihira ‘uncommon’ puti ‘white*
duwag ‘cowardly’ yayat ‘emaciated’
hilaw ‘raw’ putot ‘bent’
hinog ‘ripe’ sariwa ‘fresh’
mahal ‘expensive’ suwail ‘insolent’
mura ‘cheap tama ‘correct’
payat ‘thin’ tahimik ‘quiet’
pipi ‘dumb’ tamad ‘lazy’

There are certain types of formations and constructions in which members of this second subclass of
unaffixed adjectives occur while members of the first subclass do not. For example, virtually all members of
the second subclass occur in intensive formations with napaka- (cf. $4.12), and many members of this class
occur in exclamations after Kay (§4.24), but no members of the first subclass so occur. Thus there are
formations like napakabanal ‘very virtuous’, napakaberde ‘very green’ and constructions like kay banal ‘how
virtuous’, kay berde ‘how green’ (banal and berde belong to the second subclass of unaffixed adjectives),
but there is no “napakaayos, *napakabali, or *kay ayos, *kay bali (ayos and bali belong to the first
subclass).

Within the second subclass, there is a small group of unaffixed adjectives that are
GENDER-MARKED. These adjectives, all of which are borrowed from Spanish, occur in two different
forms: one ending in -o /oh/, the other ending in -@ /ah/. The forms ending in -a are used when the
adjectives refer to female human beings or female animals; the forms ending in -o are used in all other
cases: i.e., when the adjectives refer to male human beings or male animals, to groups including individuals
of both sexes, to inanimate objects, to abstractions, etc. Thus:

Komika si Linda. ‘Linda is funny.”
si Fred. “Fred is
ang mga bata. ‘The children are
Komiko funny.”
ang kuwento. ‘The story is
ang buhay. ‘Life is

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
198 CHAPTER 4

Some other adjectives belonging to the gender-marked subclass are:

ambisyoso/-a ‘ambitious’ nerbyoso/-a ‘nervous.
delikado/-a ‘delicate’ telihyoso/-a ‘religious’
guwapo/-a ‘handsome’ romantiko/-a ‘romantic’
lokoj-a ‘crazy’ simpatikoj-a ‘pleasing’
moderno/-a ‘modern’ tonto/-a ‘stupid’

(cf. also §3.6 for a discussion of gender-marked nouns.)

§4.3. Ma- adjectives.

Ma-adjectives consist of the prefix ma- (/ma/) and a ma-adjective base. Most ma-adjective bases also
occur independently, either as nouns or as unaffixed adjectives; a few mia-adjective bases do not occur
independently.

ma-adjective bases that occur independently as nouns may be divided into two subclasses, according
to whether the nouns designate abstract qualities or concrete objects. These two subclasses of bases differ in
distribution in the following way: bases that designate abstract qualities generally also occur in intensive
formations after napaka- (cf. §4.11), in -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ (§5.6, class G) and in exclamations after
ang or kay (§4.24); but bases that designate concrete objects do not generally occur in these formations
and constructions. Thus the base of mabigat ‘heavy’ (cf. bigat ‘weight’) also occurs in mapakabigar ‘very
heavy’, bumigat ‘become heavy’ and ang/kay bigat ‘how heavy’; but the base of mabundok ‘mountainous’
(cf. bundok ‘mountain’) does not occur in similar formations and constructions: there is no
*napakabundok, *bumundok, or *ang/kay bundok. (The distribution of ma-adjective bases that occur
independently as unaffixed adjectives and of ma-adjective bases that do not occur independently generally
resembles that of the bases that designate abstract qualities.)

The meaning expressed by a ma-adjective whose base is a noun is, gencrally: having an abundance of
what the base designates. This is the case whether the base itself designates an abstract quality or a concrete
object.

In the following list of ma-adjectives whose bases function as nouns in their independent occurrences,
the nouns are cited and translated in parentheses after the adjectives. (There are five adjectives

listed — mabundok, mabuto, madagta, malangis, and matao — whose bases designate concrete objects; the
other bases designate abstract qualities.)

mabigat ‘heavy’ (bigat ‘weight’)
mabilis ‘fast’ (bilis ‘speed’)
mabundok ‘mountainous’ (bundok ‘mountain’)
mabuto ‘bony/full of seeds’ (buto *bone/secd’)
makapal ‘thick’ (kapal ‘thickness’)
makipot ‘narrow’ (kipot ‘narrowness’)
madagta ‘rich in sap” (dagta ‘sap’)
maganda ‘beautiful’ (ganda ‘beauty’)
mahaba ‘long’ (haba ‘length’)
mahina ‘weak’ (hina ‘weakness’)
mainit ‘hot’ (init heat’)

malaki ‘big’ (laki ‘size’)
malaman ‘fleshy’ (laman ‘flesh’)
malangis ‘oily’ (langis ‘oil’)

mapait ‘bitter’ (pait ‘bitterness’)
masama ‘bad’ (sama ‘badness’)
mataas ‘high’ (taas ‘height’)
matao ‘populous’ (tao ‘person’)
matalino ‘intelligent’ (talino ‘intelligence’)
matatag ‘stable* (tatag ‘stability’)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 199

Ma-adjectives whose bases occur independently as unaffixed adjectives may be divided into two
subclasses, according to whether the a- adjective does or does not have the same meaning as the unaffixed
adjective. Examples of ma- adjectives that are more or less identical in meaning with their bases are:

maaliwalas ‘bright’ (aliwalas “bright’)
malaganap “widespread” (laganap ‘widespread’)
Mapayapa ‘peaceful’ (payapa ‘peaceful’)
masagana “prosperous” (sagana ‘prosperous’)
matapat ‘faithful’ (tapat ‘faithful’)

In cases where the ma- adjective differs in meaning from the unaffixed adjective that serves as its base,
the ma- adjective generally designates the transitory and/or non-inherent possession of a quality, the
unaffixed adjective the permanent and/or inherent possession of the quality. This is the case with many
adjectives designating color or shape. Compare the meanings of the ma- adjectives and unaffixed adjectives
in the following pairs of sentences:

Maputi ang bulaklak.
‘The flower is white (e.g., it has faded).”

Puti ang bulaklak.
‘The flower is (naturally) white.”

Madilaw ang buhok niya.
‘Her hair is yellow (e.g., bleached).’

Dilaw ang buhok niya.
‘Her hair is (naturally) yellow.’

Mabilog ang buwan.
‘The moon is full.’

Bilog ang buwan.
‘The moon is round.’

Matulis ang mga lapis.
‘The pencils are sharpened.’

Tulis ang mga lapis.
‘Pencils are pointed.”

The following are some examples of ma- adjectives whose bases do not occur as independent words
(except in ang and kay exclamations — which, as explained in §4.24, are derived from the adjectives
themselves):

maaga ‘carly” marubdob ‘ardent’
mabanas ‘sultry’ masahol ‘inferior’
maimpok ‘economical’ masinsin ‘compact’
malinis ‘clean’ matatas ‘talkative’
malusog ‘healthy’ maunlad ‘productive’

(A small group of ma- adjectives that express weather conditions, and the adjective maaga ‘early,’ may
occur as predicates in topicless phenomenal sentences — cf. §7.21.)

§4.4, Cardinal and ordinal numbers.

Like English, Tagalog distinguishes between CARDINAL NUMBERS (i.e., numbers used in counting
or in expressing quantity: cf. English ‘one’, two’, etc.) and ORDINAL NUMBERS (i.c., numbers used in
expressing order or rank: cf. English ‘first’, ‘second’, etc.). The Tagalog cardinal numbers may, for
descriptive purposes, be divided into two classes: SIMPLE and COMPLEX. Simple numbers consist of a
single meaningful element, complex numbers of more than one meaningful element. The simple cardinal
numbers of Tagalog are:

isa ‘one’ lima ‘five’

dalawa ‘two" anim ‘six”

tatlo ‘three’ pito ‘seven’

apat ‘four’ walo ‘eight’
siyam ‘nine’

All the complex numbers include at least one of the simple numbers and at least one other meaningful
element. The other meaningful elements that commonly occur in complex numbers are:

pu ‘times ten’

labi ‘ten plus’

daan ‘times one hundred’
libo ‘times one thousand’
milyon ‘times one million’

Multiples of ten are formed by adding the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) plus pu, daan, libo, or milyon to one of
the simple numbers. (The -ng form of the linker is always manifested as /m/ before pu, and this
pronunciation is reflected in the conventional spelling. The -ng form of the linker is often manifested as /n/
before daan and libo and as /m/ before milyon, but the -ng spelling — except in the case of the variant
forms for ‘one hundred’ and ‘one thousand’, sandaan and sanlibo — is retained. The first syllable of isa ‘one’
is dropped in sampu ‘ten’( < isa + linker + pu), and in sandaan and sanlibo. Daan has a variant form, raan,
which is a normal after the na form of the linker.) Examples are:

sampu ‘ten’ limampu “fifty”

dalawampu ‘twenty’ animnapu ‘sixty’

tatlumpu ‘thirty’ pitumpu ‘seventy’

apatnapu ‘forty’ walumpu ‘eighty’
siyamnapu ‘ninety’

isang daan (sandaan) ‘one hundred’

dalawang daan ‘two hundred’

tatlong daan ‘three hundred’

apat na raan ‘four hundred’

isang libo (sanlibo) ‘one thousand’

dalawang libo ‘two thousand”

isang milyon ‘one million’

dalawang milyon ‘two million’

(Three additional elements ~- /aksa ‘times ten thousand’, yuta ‘times one hundred thousand’, and angaw
‘times one million’ — are used by some Tagalog speakers in forming numbers representing multiples of ten.
When used, these elements, like pu, etc., occur after one of the simple numbers plus the linker na/-ng: isang
laksa ‘ten thousand’, isang yuta ‘one hundred thousand’, isang angaw ‘one million’. These elements are,
however, unfamiliar to perhaps the majority of educated Manila speakers, who would express ‘ten
thousand’ as sampung libo, ‘one hundred thousand’ as isang daang libo, and ‘one million’ as isang milyon.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS _ 201

Numbers from eleven to nineteen are formed by adding the linker -ng plus one of the simple numbers
to labi. (The linker is manifested as /m/, /n/, or /n/ according to whether the first consonant of the
following simple number is bilabial, dental/alveolar, or velar/glottal. The variation is reflected in the
conventional spelling.) Thus:

labing-isa ‘eleven’ labinlima ‘fifteen’

labindalawa ‘twelve’ labing-anim ‘sixteen’

labintatlo ‘thirteen’ labimpito ‘seventeen’

labing-apat ‘fourteen’ labingwalo ‘eighteen’
labinsiyam ‘ninteen’

Other complex numbers are formed with the coordinating conjunction at ‘and’ (cf. §7.19), which
occurs between any number representing a multiple of ten and another number. (As noted in §7.19, at is
optionally cotracted to ‘t /t/ after a word which, in its independent occurrences, ends in {"/, /h/, or /n/. The
final consonant of the preceding word is simultaneously dropped. The contracted form of az is normal after
the elements pu, daan and libo. Thus:

pu /pu’/ + at + pu't /put/
daan /da’an/ + at > daa’t /da’at/
libo /li*boh/ + at > libo’t /lisbut/.)
Some examples are:
dalawampu’t isa ‘twenty-one’
tatlumpu’t dalawa ‘thirty-two’
apat na raa’t sampu ‘four hundred ten’
limang libo’t labing-isa ‘five thousand eleven’

siyam na libo’t siyam na raa’t siyam na pu’t siyam
‘nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine’

isang milyon at limang daang libo.
‘one million five hundred thousand’

There is only one common expression for a fraction: kalahati ‘(a) half — cf. §3.22. Kalahati may
occur without other numbers, or it may be joined by the conjunction at (or its contracted form ‘t) toa
preceding cardinal number, as in isa’t kalahati ‘one and a half, (Arithmetic is taught in English in the
Philippines; hence no extensive Tagalog vocabulary for fractions has developed.)

Tagalog has two common ways of expressing ‘about’ or ‘approximately’ with cardinal numbers. One
is the particle mga {manah/, which immediately precedes the number. (This particle is homonymous with
the pluralizing particle mga discussed in § §3.9 and 4.11.) The other is the expression A(um igit-kKumulang
(literally, ‘exceed fall-short’, ie., ‘more or less’), which also precedes the number, but is separated from it
by the linker na/-ng (as well as, optionally, by any enclitic particles that may be present — cf. §6.6). Some
examples of the use of mga and h(um igit-Kumulang with cardinal numbers are:

mga

May dalawampung tao doon noong Biyernes.
h(um)igit-kumulang na

‘There were approximately twenty people there last Friday.’

mga

Naghintay ako nang isang Oras.

h(um)igit-kumulang na
‘I waited about one hour.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
202 CHAPTER 4

Mga

dalawang daan na
H(um)igit-kumulang na sila.
H(um)igit-kumulang nang dalawang daan

‘There are about two hundred of them now.’
(Literally: ‘They are now about two hundred.’)

Tagalog has two sets of ordinal numbers, one formed by prefixing ika — to the cardinal numbers, the
other formed by prefixing pang- to the cardinal numbers. In both sets the first three ordinal numbers are
irregular. (In the ika- set, the expected but non-occurring form for ‘first’, *ikaisa, is replaced by the Spanish
loan-word una which in turn serves as the base of the first member of the pang- set, panguna. Sce the list
below for the other irregular formations.) Pang- shows the variant forms pam-, pan-, and pang-, according to
whether the first consonant of the cardinal number is bilabial, dental/alveolar, or velar/glottal. Examples of
the ordinal numbers are listed below:

ika- Formation pang: Formation

una panguna ‘first’
ikalawa pangalawa ‘second*
ikatlo pangatlo ‘third’
ika-apat pang-apat ‘fourth’
ikalima panlima ‘fifth’
ika-anim pang-anim ‘sixth’
ikapito pampito ‘seventh’
ikawalo pangwalo ‘eighth’
ikasiyam pansiyam ‘ninth’
ikasampu pansampu ‘tenth’
ikalabing-isa panlabing-isa ‘eleventh’
ikadalawampu pandalawampu ‘twentieth’
ika-isang-daan pang-isang-daan ‘one hundredth’

The pang- and ika- formations are both quite common for the first twenty ordinals. For higher ordinals, the
ika- formations are common, the pang- formations relatively rare.

In addition to the numbers dealt with above, Tagalog uses numbers borrowed from Spanish and
English in certain semantic contexts. The borrowed numbers have, in general, the forms that they have in
the language of origin, but their pronunciation is in many cases slightly modified so as to conform to the
Tagalog phonemic system. For example, Spanish diez ‘ten’ is borrowed as diyes ({dye‘s/~/diye’s/), and
English three as a Tagalog word is pronounced /trivh/. (The sequence diez y in Spanish numbers is
pronounced /disi/- in Tagalog, as in /disisye'teh/ ‘seventcen’ (Spanish diez y siete).) In conventional Tagalog
spelling, Spanish numbers are respelled to reflect their Tagalog pronunciation; English spellings for English
numbers are retained.

There are some semantic contexts in which a Tagalog speaker has the option of using numbers from
any one of the different sets (i.e., numbers of Spanish, English, or native Tagalog origin), others in which he
may use numbers from either of two of these sets, and still others in which numbers from only one of the
sets may be used. Numbers of Tagalog origin are the most versatile, numbers of English origin the most
restricted in their occurrence — at least in standard formal Tagalog. (In the following presentation of the
uses of numbers in various semantic contexts, English numbers are, in general, discussed in detail only
where their usage in Tagalog differs from native English usage.)

The following are some of the more common semantic contexts in which numbers are used:

(1) ADDRESSES. Spanish and English cardinal numbers are used. the latter only colloquially. The

Spanish numbers are more or less obligatorily preceded by the word numero; the name of the street is
optionally preceded by the word kalye ‘street’ or by daang (daan ‘strect’ plus the linker na/-ng):

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 203

numero dos

Nakatira siya sa (kalye/daang) Medel.
two
‘He lives at number two Medel Street.”

(Kalye and daang are not used where the name of the street includes a word designating a
thoroughfare: e.g., Abenida Rizal ‘Rizal Avenue’, Dewey Boulevard.)
House numbers are read as follows:

those below 100 are read as regular numbers:

dos
2 8
two

nobenta’y singko
95:
ninety-five
100 or a higher number is normally read as a series of single numbers:
uno, — sero sero
100 : one, {zero, zero
oh, oh
dos, tres, sais
236 :
two, three, six
uno, kuwatro, kuwatro, singko
1445:
one, four, four, five

(There are, however, many allowable variations. Thus ‘100° may also be one hundred (but not the Spanish

siyento), ‘236’ may also be ‘two (hundred) thirty-six’ or dos (siyentos) treyntay sais, and ‘1445’ may also
be ‘fourteen-forty-five’ or katorse kKuwarenta'y singko.)

(2) DATES. Tagalog, English and Spanish numbers are used for the days of the month. The Tagalog
numbers are preferred in formal situations. Expressions using Tagalog numbers consist of a member of the
ika- set of ordinal numbers (i.e., una ‘first’, ikalawa ‘second’, etc.) followed by the linker na/-ng, araw ‘day’,
the marker ng, and buwen ‘month’ and its modifiers, in the order given. Examples are:

unang araw buwang ito
ikatlong araw ng buwang susunod

ikaapat na araw buwan ng Nobyembre

‘first day this month’
“third day of next month’
‘fourth day the month of November’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
204 CHAPTER 4

The linker and araw are optional, except after una ‘first’. Buwan ng is optional before the name of a month.
Thus, also:

ikatlo ng buwang ito
‘third of this month’

ikaapat ng Nobyembre
‘fourth of November’

(The last day of the month may be referred to by the phrase katapusan ng buwan ‘end of the month’.)

Expressions using Spanish numbers consist of a- plus the ordinal number primero ‘first’ or a- plus a
higher cardinal number, followed by a ng phrase identifying the month:

a-primero Hulyo
Darating siya sa ng
a-treynta buwang ito

first July
‘He will arrive on the of
thirtieth this month

In expressions using English numbers, either ordinal or cardinal numbers may be used. The number
follows the name of the month (which is expressed as in English):

first
sa July ‘on July first’

one

(The English alternative forms using an ‘of phrase — e.g., ‘the fifth of July’ — have not been borrowed into
Tagalog.)
Years may also be expressed in Tagalog, Spanish, or English numbers: e.g.,

mil nobesiyentos kuwarenta y uno

isang libo’t siyam na raa’t apatnapu't isa
nineteen forty-one

(3) GRADE LEVELS. The word baytang ‘step,’ preceded by a Tagalog ordinal number and the linker
naj-ng, is used in expressions denoting grade levels in the school system. For grade tevels in the elementary
school, grado ‘grade’ is also used:

baytang

unang (ng mababang paaralan)
grado

‘first grade (of elementary school)’

For high-school grades, only baytang is used:

ikaapat na baytang (ng mataas na paaralan)
‘fourth year (of high school)’

(English terms are also used colloquially: ¢.g., first grade, second year, etc., with modifications only
in pronunciation:

Fourth year na si Anita sa unibersidad.
‘Anita is now (in the) fourth year at the university.’)

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 205

(4) MEASUREMENT. The term measurement, as used here, includes the following semantic
areas: (a) AGE; (b) MONEY; (c) PERCENTAGE; (d) LENGTH, TIME, VOLUME, WEIGHT, and
STANDARD QUANTITY. Both Tagalog and Spanish numbers occur in expressions falling within the first
three of these areas; only Tagalog numbers occur in expressions falling within the fourth area. (While
Tagalog numbers are used for expressions of time measurement, Spanish numbers are normally used for
expressing clock time — cf. (6), below.) The constructions involving Tagalog numbers consist in all cases of
a cardinal number followed by the linker na/-ng and a noun designating a unit of measurement: e¢.g.,

dalawang ‘two
piso pesos’
apat na ‘four

(When the number includes at kalahati ‘and a half’, this expression may either precede the linker or
follow the noun designating the unit of measurement: e¢.g., apat at Kalahating kilo or apat na kilo't kalahati
‘four and a half kilograms’. When a number including at Kalahati is used to modify a noun that does not
designate a unit of measurement, kalahati always precedes the linker. Thus ‘four and a half apples’ is apart at
kalahating mansanas, not *apat na mansanas at kalahati.) The constructions involving Spanish numbers
consist in all cases of a cardinal number followed by a noun designating the unit of measurement: ¢.g.,

dos ‘two
pesos pesos’
kuwatro ‘four

Expressions of measurement that fall within the semantic areas listed above are presented below in
the listed order.

(a) AGE. Most expressions involving the measurement of units of time use only Tagalog numbers (see
(d), below). For expressing a person’s age, however, either Tagalog or Spanish numbers may in most cases
be used, the latter only colloquially. With Tagalog numbers, the nouns faon ‘year(s)’ and buwan ‘month(s)’
are used. Ages up to two years are not expressed with Spanish numbers. Ages of two or more years may be
expressed, colloquially, by a Spanish number followed by anyos ‘years’.

(The enclitic particles na ‘now/already* and la(ma rg ‘only’ (cf. §§6.3 and 6.4) are often used after
expressions of age. Since, as is noted in §3.29, subsection (I.B.7), non-final components of age expressions
are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic, the enclitic particles follow the entire age expression:

Isang taon

na
Apat na buwan ( ) ang bata.

la(ma)ng
Isang taon at apat na buwan
‘The child is now one year

ina ) four months old.’
one year and four months
Anim na taon
na siya.

Singko anyos

‘He is five years old.”
(Literally: ‘He is now five years old.’)

(b) MONEY. The centavo is the smallest unit of Philippine currency; one hundred centavos is one
peso. With Tagalog numbers, the centavo is called either pera or sentimo. (With Tagalog numbers expressing

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
206 CHAPTER 4

‘two’ or more, an -s is optionally added to sentimo.) With Spanish numbers expressing ‘two’ or more, the
centavo is called sentimos. (No Spanish number is used for ‘one centavo’.) Thus:

pera
isang ‘one centavo”
sentimo
pera
dalawang
sentimo(s) “two centavos’

dos sentimos

(Piseta ‘twenty centavos’ and salapi ‘fifty centavos’ are common as names of denominations, but are not
often used as units for reckoning monetary value.) With Tagalog numbers, the peso is called piso. (The
meaning ‘one peso’ is normally expressed by piso alone, without a preceding number.) With Spanish
numbers expressing ‘two’ or more, the peso is called pesos. (No Spanish number is used for ‘one peso’.)
Thus:

piso ‘one peso”

dalawang piso
“two pesos”
dos pesos

The Spanish numbers are often used independently, without sentimos or pesos, when the monetary
unit intended is clear from the context:

Beynte-singko ang pasahe.
‘The fare is twenty-five (centavos).”

Dos-singkuwenta ang tsinelas.
‘The slippers are two (pesos)-fifty (centavos.)

(While no Spanish number is used to express exactly one peso, the number uno may be used in expressions
for amounts between one and two pesos, without pesos or sentimos expressed: e.g., uno-singkuwenta ‘one
(peso)-fifty (centavos).’)

In sentences expressing both quantity and cost, the expression of cost may occur in predicate
position, the expression of quantity (which uses numbers of Tagalog origin only) in topic position preceded
by the marker ang: ¢.g.,

Limang piso

ang dalawa.
Singko (pesos)

‘Two for five pesos.”
(Literally: ‘The two are five pesos.)

An alternative construction places the expression of quantity before the expression of cost, with no
intervening ang: e.g.,
limang piso.

Dalawa

singko (pesos).

‘Two for five pesos.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

This latter construction may itself function as the predicate of a sentence, as a modifier in a modification

construction, etc: e.g.,

Dalawa-

limang-piso

ang silya.

singko (pesos)

‘The chairs are two for five pesos.’

Bumili siya ng dalawa-

limang-piso

ang silya.
singko (pesos) na

‘He bought some two-for-five-peso chairs.”

(Cf. §4.5, subsection (a) for a discussion of distributive numerals in relation to expressions of money.)
(c) PERCENTAGE. Both Tagalog and Spanish numbers are used with the word porsyento (from
Spanish por ciento) to form expressions denoting percentage. Examples are:

Tagalog
isang porsyento

anim na porsyento
sandaang porsyento

Spanish

uno porsyento
seis porsyento
siyento porsyento

“one per cent”
‘six per cent’
‘one hundred per cent’

(d) LENGTH, TIME, VOLUME, WEIGHT, AND STANDARD QUANTITY. While only Tagalog
numbers are used, many of the nouns designating the units of measurement are borrowed from Spanish.

Some examples are:

Length:

Time:

Volume:

Weight:

Standard Quantity:

pulgada ‘inch’

yarda ‘yard’
metro ‘meter’
kilometro ‘kilometer’
tmilya ‘mile’

piye ‘foot’
segundo ‘second’
minuto ‘minute’
oras ‘hour’
kutsarita ‘teaspoonful’
kutsara ‘tablespoonful”
tasa ‘cupful’
litro ‘liter’

galon ‘gallon’

onsa ‘ounce’

libra ‘pound’
kilo ‘kilogram’
pares ‘pair’

dusena ‘dozen’

There are also nouns of native Tagalog origin used to designate units of length, etc.: e.g.,

dali

Length: dangkal

dipa

‘finger-width’
“‘handspan’

(length of both arms outstretched)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
208 CHAPTER 4

Time: araw ‘day’
linggo ‘week’
buwan ‘month’
taon ‘year’
Volume: dakot ‘handful’
gatang (approx. one cup, used for non-liquids)
salop ‘ganta’ (three liters, used for non-liquids)

Expressions of measurement consisting of a cardinal number plus the linker na/-ng plus a noun
designating a unit of measurement often occur as preposed modifiers in complex modification
constructions (cf. §3.17) e.g.,

isang yardang tela ‘a yard of cloth’
dalawang salop na bigas “two gantas of rice’

They also occur in a construction in which they are followed by a ng phrase of specification (cf.
§3.23): e.g.,

isang yarda ng tela ‘a yard of the cloth’
dalawang salop ng bigas ‘two gantas of the rice’

(5) PAGE NUMBERS. Tagalog ordinal or English cardinal numbers, the latter only colloquially, are
used for designating page numbers. In expressions using Tagalog numbers, the word pahina ‘page’ (from
Spanish pagina) is preceded by the number plus the linker na/-ng:

unang pahina ‘page one”
ikalimandaang pahina ‘page five hundred’

Expressions using English numbers retain the original form: page two, page three, etc.
(6) CLOCK TIME. Spanish cardinal numbers are normally used in expressing clock time.
(Expressions of time measurement, however, always involve Tagalog numbers — cf. (4.d), above. Thus:

Naghintay kami hanggang alas dos.
‘We waited until two o’clock.

Naghintay kami nang dalawang oras.
‘We waited for two hours.)

The number that expresses the hour is preceded by ala- in the case of wna ‘one’, by alas in all other cases.
Thus:

ala-una ‘one o'clock’
alas dos ‘two o'clock’
alas dose ‘twelve o'clock’

Minutes after the hour are expressed by y plus a number, or in some cases, by a number alone, after the
ala(s) expression. (The y is optional, and omitted more often than not, when the preceding word ends in a
consonant.)

ala-una y singko ‘one-five*
alas tres(y)beynte ‘three-twenty”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 203

Minutes before the hour are expressed by senos plus a number plus para, before the alafs) expression:

menos singko para ala-una ‘five to one’
menos beynte para alas tres “twenty to three’

(The half hour is frequently expressed by medya ‘half, the quarter hour by kuwartfo ‘quarter’. Thus:

ala-una y medya ‘half-past one’
alas singko y kuwarto ‘a quarter past five”
menos kuwarto para alas otso ‘a quarter to cight’

In formal style (primarily in writing), Tagalog numbers are sometimes used in expressing the time of
day. Time-of-day expressions involving Tagalog numbers obligatorily end with one of the following ng
phrases: ng umaga ‘in the morning’, ng tanghali ‘noon’, ng hapon ‘in the afternoon’, ng gabi ‘in the
evening’, ng hatinggabi ‘midnight’. (These phrases are optional after time-of-day expressions involving
Spanish numbers. Thus:

alas dose ‘twelve o'clock’
alas dose ng tanghali ‘twelve noon’
alas dose ng hatinggabi ‘twelve midnight’
but only:
ikalabindalawa ng tanghali ‘twelve noon*
ikalabindalawa ng hatinggabi ‘twelve midnight’

‘Twelve o'clock’ cannot be expressed by “ikalabindalawa.) Hours are expressed by ordinal numbers of the
ika- set. ‘One o’clock’ is unang oras; hours after one are expressed by an ika- ordinal without a following
oras. Thus:

unang oras ng umaga ‘one in the morning’
ikalawa ng umaga ‘two in the morning’

- Minutes after the hour are expressed by a cardinal number plus the linker na/-ng plus minuto pagkaraan ng
before the ordinal number:

limang minuto pagkaraan ng ikalawa ng umaga
“‘two-five in the morning’

Minutes before the hour ase expressed by a cardinal number plus the linker na/-ng plus minuto bago mag-
before the ordinal number:

limang minuto bago mag-ikalawa ng umaga
‘five to two in the morning’

(The half hour may be expressed by at (or ‘t) kalahati after the ordinal number:
ikalawa’t kalahati ng umaga

‘one-thirty in the morning’)

§4.5. Other numerical expressions.
In addition to cardinal and ordinal numbers (§4.4), Tagalog has numerical expressions of five kinds.
These are: (a) DISTRIBUTIVE NUMERALS; (b) RESTRICTIVE NUMERALS; (c) GROUPING

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
210 CHAPTER 4

NUMERALS; (d) INDEFINITE NUMERALS; (ce) FREQUENTATIVE NUMERALS.
(a) DISTRIBUTIVE NUMERALS. Distributive numerals are used to express equal distribution. They
are translated by English constructions that involve a cardinal number and ‘each’: e.g.,

Bigyan mo kami ng tigalawang lapis.
‘Give us two pencils each.’
Tigsasampung piso

ang mga pontimpen.

Tigdidiyes (pesos)
‘The fountain pens are ten pesos each.’

There are two sets of distributive numerals, one corresponding to cardinal numbers of Tagalog origin, the

other to cardinal numbers of Spanish origin. Except for the first four members of the Tagalog set (see

below), each distributive numberal consists of the prefix tig-, a duplicating syllable, and a cardinal number,

in that order. (The formation of the duplicating syllable follows the rules given for dup,- in §3.7.)
Examples of distributive numerals corresponding to cardinal numbers of Tagalog origin are:

tiglilimah /tiglili(-)mah/ ‘five each’ (cf. lima flimah/tive’)
tig-aanim /tig’a’a‘nim/ ‘six each’ (cf. anim /’anim} ‘six’)
tigsisyam /tigsisyam/ ‘nine each’ (cf. siyam /syam/ ‘nine’)

(Tiglilima is irregular in that length is optionally added to the penultimate vowel of the base.) Examples of
distributive numerals corresponding to cardinal numbers of Spanish origin are:

tigdudos /tigdudo’s/ “two each’ (cf. dos /do's/ *two’)
tigtitres /tigtritres/ ‘three each’ (cf. tres /tre's/ ‘three’)
tigkukwatro /tigkukwa‘troh/ ‘four each’ (cf. kuwatro /kwa:troh/ ‘four’)

There are three different distributive forms that correspond to each of the first four cardinal numbers
of Tagalog origin. The two most common forms in each case are:

tigi-tigisa and ligisa ‘one each’ (cf. isa ‘one’
/tigi-tigi*sah/ {tigitsah/ fisah/)
tiga-tigalawa and tigalawa “two each’ (cf. dalawa ‘two’
/tiga*tigala‘wah/ /tigala‘wah/ {dalawah/)
tiga-tigatlo and tigatlo “three each’ (cf. tatlo ‘three’
/tiga-tigatloh/ /tigatloh/ [tatloh/)
tiga-tig-apat and tig-apat ‘four each’ (cf. apat ‘four’
/tiga*tiga*pat/ /tiga*pat/ f’a"pat/)

The first form listed is the preferred form in the RECIPIENT-TOPIC CONSTRUCTION discussed below;
the second form is the preferred form in other cases. The third form follows the rules of formation
previously given for other distributive numerals. This form is not often used in standard formal Tagalog, but
is occasionally heard in speech.

(In addition to the distributive numerals, there are four special distributive forms used in expressing
equal distribution of money. These forms are: mamera ‘one centavo each" (cf. pera ‘(one) centavo’),
mamiso ‘one peso each’ (cf. piso ‘(one) peso’), mamiseta ‘twenty centavos cach’ (cf. piseta ‘twenty
centavos’), and manalapi ‘fifty centavos cach’ (cf. salapi ‘fifty centavos’). The last two are relatively rare;
the first two are very common, especially in quoting prices.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS a1

In general, a given distributive numeral may occur only in those semantic contexts in which the
cardinal number to which it corresponds occurs. Thus, in contexts in which either Tagalog or Spanish
cardinal numbers may be used (as in expressing most amounts of money: ¢.g., dalawang piso or dos pesos
“two pesos’), either Tagalog or Spanish distributive numerals may also be used (e.g., tigalawang piso or
tigdudos pesos “two pesos each’), And in contexts in which only Tagalog cardinal numbers are used (as in
expressing measurements: e.g., dalawang yarda ‘two yards,’ not *dos yarda), only Tagalog distributive
numerals are used (¢.g., tigalawang yarda ‘two yards each,’ not *tigdudos yarda).

Apart from constructions in which they may be considered as distributive substitutes for cardinal
numbers, distributive numerals also occur in one type of construction that is unique to them: the
RECIPIENT-TOPIC CONSTRUCTION. In this construction, the predicate of the sentence expresses
something that is to be distributed in equal portions, the topic the recipients of these portions. (The English
equivalents often involve ‘each of . . . is to get’. The predicate is introduced by a distributive numeral, or by
a phrase consisting of a distributive numeral plus the linker na/-ng plus a nominal representing a unit of
Measurement. The distributive numeral or distributive-numeral phrase is followed by a ng phrase of
specification (cf. §3.23) if what is to be distributed represents a selection from a specific group: e.g.,

Tigi-tigisa

ng kendi ang mga bata.
Tigi-tigisang piraso
one of the candies.”
‘Each of the children is to get

one piece of the candy.”

If what is to be distributed does not represent a selection from a specific group, the distributive numeral or
distributive-numeral phrase is followed by the linker #a/-ng and a nominal: e.g.,

Tigi-tigisang
kendi ang mga bata.
Tigi-tigisang pirasong
one
‘Each of the children is to get candy.’
one piece of

Some further examples are:

Tigsasampu raw kayo ng libro.
‘They say that each of you is to get ten of the books.’

Tigsasampung libro raw kayo.
‘They say that each of you is to get ten books.’

(Note that, in the recipient-topic construction, enclitic particles and pronouns — cf. § §3.29 and 6.2 ) never
occur directly before a linker followed by a nominal representing what is to be distributed. Thus:

Tigi-tigisang kendi ba sila?
‘Are they each to get one candy?”
not:
*Tigi-tigisa ba silang kendi?

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
212 CHAPTER 4

Enclitics may, however, optionally occur directly before a linker followed by a nominal representing a unit
of measurement, whether or not this nominal is in tum followed by a linker plus a nominal representing

what is to be distributed. Thus:

Tigi-tigisa ba silang piraso(ng kendi)?
‘Are they each to get one piece (of candy)?

as well as:
Tigi-tigisang piraso(ng kendi) ba sila?)

(b) RESTRICTIVE NUMERALS. Restrictive numerals are used to express the equivalent of English
‘only’ plus a cardinal number: e.g., fisa j‘i"‘isah{ ‘only one’, sasampu {sa’sampu’/ ‘only ten’. They are
formed by prefixing a duplicating syllable to a cardinal number. (The formation of the duplicating syllable
follows the rules given for dup,- in §5.19.) The cardinal number that follows the duplicating syllable may
be of either Tagalog or Spanish origin. (The two sets of restrictive numerals occur only in those semantic
contexts in which the related cardinal numbers occur.) Some further examples are:

dadalawa /da‘dalawah/

‘only two’
dodos /dodo's/

tatatlo /ta*tatloh/
‘only three”

tetres /te-tres/

aapat /’a"’a-pat/
‘only four’
kukwatro /ku‘kwatroh/

Restrictive numerals are most commonly used as indefinite predicates or as the first element of
modification constructions serving as indefinite predicates. In these uses the restrictive numeral denotes an

amount viewed as relatively small: e.g.,

lisa ang bulaklak.
‘There is only one flower.”
(Literally: ‘The flower is only one.’)

lisang maliit na mangga ang kinain niya.
‘He ate only one small mango.’
(Literally: ‘What he ate was only one small mango.’)

Restrictive numerals that designate amounts viewed as relatively small are often followed by the enclitic
particles lafma ng ‘only’, na la(ma ng ‘now only’, or pa la(ma)ng ‘still only’. If the restrictive numeral is the
first element of a modification construction, la(maig, ctc., normally follow the entire modification
construction, but may also follow the numeral if the modification construction includes another modifier.
Some examples are:

Dadalawa(ng isda) la(ma)ng ang nahuli ko.
‘L caught only two (fish).’
(Literally: ‘What I caught was only two (fish).”)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 213

Tatatlong paketeng sigarilyo na la(ma)ng
ang natitira.
Tatatlo na la(ma)ng (na) paketeng sigarilyo
‘There are now only three packs of cigarettes left.’
(Literally: “What is left is now only three packs of cigarettes.”)

Aapat (na bulaklak) pa la(ma)ng ang nasa rosas.
‘There are still only four (flowers) on the rose bush.’
(Literally: ‘What is on the rose bush is still only four (flowers).’)

(When lafmna)ng is present, a restrictive meaning is conveyed even if a cardinal number, rather than a
restrictive numeral, is used. Thus ‘I caught only two’ may also be Dalawa la(ma)ng ang nahuli ko.)
Restrictive numerals also occur after ang, either in topic position or in a definite predicate (cf.
§7.17). The ang-plus-restrictive-numeral construction is equivalent to an English construction with ‘the
only’ plus a number, and denotes an amount which, though restricted, is the total available amount: e.g.,

Ito ang aapat (na manggang hinog).
‘These are the only four (ripe mangoes).”

Ang aapat (na manggang hinog) ang kinain niya.
‘He ate the only four ripe mangoes.”
(Literally: ‘What he ate was the only four (ripe mangoes).’

(The restrictive numerals show formal and semantic similarity to the limiters Kekaunti ‘only a little’
and iilan ‘only a few’, discussed in §3.22.)

(c) GROUPING NUMERALS. Grouping numerals normally express the equivalent of English *by’ or
‘in (groups of)’ plus a pluralized cardinal number: ¢.g., dala-dalawa /dala:dalawah/ ‘by twos, in pairs’,
lima-lima /limalimah} ‘by fives, in groups of five’. They are formed by prefixing two duplicating syllables to
a cardinal number of Tagalog origin. The duplicating syllables are identical with the Sst wo syllables of
the cardinal number, except that: (1) if the second syllable of the cardinal number ends in a short vowel,
or a short vowel plus /’/, the second duplicating syllable ends in a long vowel; (2) if the second syllable of
the cardinal number ends in a short vowel plus /h/, this /h/ is absent in the second duplicating syllable;
(3) if the second vowel of the cardinal number is /o/, the vowel of the second duplicating syllable is /u/.
Some further examples are:

isa-isa fisa’isah} ‘by ones’

tatlu-tatlo /tatlutatloh/ ‘by threes, in groups of three’
apat-apat }’a'pat’a’ pat} ‘by fours, in groups of four’
sampu-sampu /sampu‘sampu’/ ‘by tens, in groups of ten’
dala-dalawampu /dala‘dalawampu’/ ‘by twenties, in groups of twenty.’

The grouping numerals most commonly occur in adverbial phrases of manner introduced by nang (cf.
$6.10): e.g.,

Lumakad sila nang dala-dalawa.
by twos.”
‘They walked
in pairs.”

Ayusin mo nang apat-apat ang (mga) kamatis.
‘Arrange the tomatoes in groups of four.”

They also occur as predicates before gerunds (cf. §3.26) occurring in topic position: e.g.,
Apat-apat ang pagbilang niya ng (mga) kamatis.

‘He counted the tomatoes in groups of four.’
(Literally: ‘His counting of the tomatoes was by fours.”)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
214 CHAPTER 4

In addition to the expression of a grouping, a grouping numeral may be used to express the idea of
excessive number, as in:

Bakit dala-dalawa ang lapis mo?
‘Why do you have two pencils (when only one is needed).”

(d) INDEFINITE NUMERALS. Indefinite numerals are used to express a large, but indefinite,
number. They consist of a repeated utterance of certain of the clements used in the formation of complex
cardinal numbers. The indefinite numerals in common use are:

daan-daan ‘hundreds’
libu-libo ‘thousands’
angaw-angaw ‘millions’

(Milyon-milyon ‘millions’ also occurs, but is less common than the forms listed above.) Like their English
equivalents, the indefinite numerals can often be used more or less interchangeably, to indicate ‘a large
number.’ Some examples of their use are:

Daan-dan
Libu-libo ang kaibigan niya.
Angaw-angaw
hundreds
‘He has thousands of friends.”
millions
daan-daang
Hinahangaan siya ng libu-libong tao.
angaw-angaw na
‘Hundreds
‘Thousands of people admire him.’
‘Millions

(e) FREQUENTATIVE NUMERALS. Frequentative numerals express the equivalent of an English
phrase consisting of a cardinal number plus ‘times’: e.g., makaapat /maka(-)’a‘pat/ ‘four times’,
makasampu /maka(*)sampu’/ ‘ten times’. They are formed by prefixing maka- (/maka/ of {maka’/ — the
form with inherent vowel length is probably the more common) to a cardinal number of Tagalog origin. In
most cases, the form of the cardinal number is retained intact within the frequentative numeral. The
frequentative formations based on dalawa ‘two’ and fatlo ‘three’ are, however, irregular:

makalawa {maka()lawah/ “two times, twice’
makaitlo {maka(‘)’itloh/ ‘three times’

Some further examples of regular formations are:

makalima {maka(‘)limah/ ‘five times’
makaanim {maka(‘)’a°nim/ ‘six times’
makaapatnapu /maka(‘)’apatnapu’/ ‘forty times’

(There is no maka- formation based upon isa ‘onc’. The equivalent of ‘one time, once’ is expressed by
minsan.)

Frequentative numerals are used to form nang frequency adverbs. For discussion and illustrations of
these adverbs, cf. §6.8, subsection (1.a).

In addition to the ang, ng, and sa forms presented in §3.4, and the nasa forms presented in section
$4.19, there are distinctive forms of the deictic pronouns that are equivalent to the sentence-initial ‘here”
and ‘there’ of English sentences such as: ‘Here/There he is’, ‘Here’s/There’s the water, boiling already’, etc.
These distinctive forms may be called ATTENTION-DIRECTING DEICTICS. (Note that the English
equivalents of the attention-directing deictics are distinguished from locatives only by position in the
sentence (compare ‘Here he is’, in which ‘here’ is attention-directing, and ‘He is here’, in which ‘here’ is
locative). The Tagalog attention-directing and locative deictics, on the other hand, are formally distinct
(compare (Hero siya ‘Here he is’ and Narito siya ‘He is here’.).

Tagalog has four attention-directing deictics, onc corresponding to each of the usual deictic categories
(cf. §3.4). Three of the four attention-directing deictics occur in two freely alternating forms, one with
initial /hj, the other with initial /'/. The following is a list of the attention-directing deictics, in both
conventional spelling and phonemic transcription. To the right of each attention-directing deictic appears
its English-translation equivalent, and the ang- form deictic to which it corresponds,

ere Pereh{ ‘here’ (iri)
fhetoh/

(h)eto ‘here’ (ito)
fe'toh{
/hayan/

(h)ayan ‘there’ (iyan)
[ayanf
[hayon/

(b)ayun ‘there’ (iyon)
Iayon/

Attention-directing deictics occur only in sentence-initial position. They may constitute sentences in
themselves, equivalent to English ‘Here/There (it is)’:

Ere.

‘Here (it is).’
(H)eto.
(H)ayan.

‘There (it is).”
(H)ayun.

Or they may occur as predicates with topics of the usual kinds:

Ere

ang bus. ‘Here’s the bus."
(H)eto
(H)ayan

si Pedro. ‘There’s Pedro.”
(H)ayun

Attention-directing deictics also occur in a construction in which they are followed by at and a
clause. The clause following af in this construction is in itself a complete statement, and includes a
predicate and a topic. The construction combines the function of directing the listener's attention to what
is expressed by the topic with that of making the statement. Some examples are:

 
216 CHAPTER 4

Ere at biyuda na siya.
‘Here she is, a widow already.”

(cf. Biyuda na siya.
‘She is already a widow.")

kukulo
(H)cto at kumukulo na ang tubig.
kumulo

about to boil already.”
‘Here’s the water boiling now.”
boiled already (having boiled).

Kukulo
(cf. ¢ Kumukulo na ang tubig.
Kumulo

is already about to boil.
‘The water is boiling now.” )
has boiled.’

(H)ayan at walang laman ang baso mo.
‘There’s your glass empty.”

(cf. Walang laman ang baso mo.
‘Your glass is empty.’)

(H)ayun at nasa isang taxi sila.
‘There they are in a taxi.’

(cf. Nasa isang taxi sila.
‘They are in a taxi.’)

§4.7. Pa- adjectives.

There are adjectives of three types formed with the prefix pa: INTERMITTENT-ACTIVITY
ADJECTIVES, INCIPIENT-ACTIVITY ADJECTIVES, and pa MANNER ADJECTIVES.
Intermittent-activity adjectives consist of pa- plus two duplicating syllables, and a base. (The formation of
the duplicating syllables follows the rules given for dup3- in §5.16.) The duplicating syllables and the base
in most cases also occur in a moderative directional -um- verb (cf. §5.16, subsection (2.b)) that expresses
the occasional or diffuse performance of an activity. The adjective has essentially the same meaning as the
related verb, except that it expresses the performance of the activity as a characteristic, rather than as an
occurrence. The English equivalents of both the verb and the adjective normally involve a verb accompanied
by an adverbial expression such as ‘sometimes’, ‘occasionally’, ‘once in a while’, ‘now and then’, or ‘here
and there’. Some examples are:

Pa- Adjective Meaning -um- Verb
padalu-dalo ‘attend now and then’ dumalu-dalo
pagala-gala ‘wander here and there (in)’ gumala-gala
palahuk-lahok join once in a while’ lumahuk-lahok
pasama-sama ‘accompany occasionally’ sumama-sama
patira-tira ‘live (at) sometimes’ tumira-tira
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 217

The same directional complements (8 phrases) that follow the moderative verbs follow ‘the

intermittent-activity adjectives: ¢.g.,

Padalu-dalo sa sayawan sina Maria.
‘Maria and her friends attend dances now and then.’

(cf. Dumalu-dalo sa sayawan sina Maria.
‘Maria and her friends attended dances now and then.”)

Pagala-gala sila sa palengke araw-araw.
‘They wander here and there in the market every day.”

(cf. Gumala-gala sila sa palengke araw-araw.
‘They wandered here and there in the market every day.’)

There is at least one intermittent-activity adjective, paminsan-minsan ‘occasional(ly),’ that is not
related to an -urm verb. An example of its use is:

Paminsan-minsan ang baha dito.
‘There are floods here occasionally.’
(Literally: ‘The floods here are occasional.)

Incipient-activity adjectives, like most intermittent-activity adjectives, include pa- and a base that also
occurs as the base of a directional -wim- verb. The base is, however, not preceded by duplicating syllables.
Incipient-activity adjectives are often equivalent to English ‘starting to’ plus a verb. Some examples are:

paakyat ‘starting to climb’ (cf. umakyat ‘climb’)
paalis ‘starting to leave’ (cf. umalis ‘leave’)
palubog ‘starting to set/sink’ (cf. lumubog ‘set/sink’)
papunta ‘starting to go’ (cf. pumunta ‘go’)
pauwi ‘starting to go home’ (cf. umuwi ‘go home’)

Incipient-activity adjectives are frequently followed by the enclitic particle na ‘now/already": ¢.g.,

Paak at na siya (sa bundok.)
‘He is starting to climb (the mountain) now.’

Palubog na ang araw.
‘The sun is starting to set now.”

Pauwi na ako.
‘I'm starting to go home now.’ (‘I’m on my way home.’)

Pa- manner adjectives consist of pa- plus a base that also occurs as the base of one of the following: a

directional -um- verb, an intransitive -u- verb (cf. §5.6, class E), or an intransitive mag- yerb (cf. §5.6,
class G). The adjective is often equivalent to an adverbial expression of manner in English: e.g.,

pabulong ‘in a whisper’ (cf. bumulong ‘whisper’)

padabog ‘with motions of anger’ (cf. dumabog ‘move angrily’)
pahinanakit ‘in an injured manner’ (cf. maghinanakit ‘have injured feelings’)
paismid ‘with a grimace’ (cf. umismid ‘grimace’)

pangiti ‘smilingly’ (cf. ngumiti ‘smile’)

pasayaw ‘as if dancing’ (cf. sumayaw ‘dance’)

patagilid ‘sideways’ (cf. tumagilid ‘move sideways’)

218 CHAPTER 4

Except when they initiate certain adjective-plus-complement constructions (cf. §4.17), manner
adjecties occur as predicates only with topics of the following types: gerunds (cf. §3.26) and nominalized
verb bases (cf. §3.27). Some examples are:

pagsasalita
Pabulong ang ni Pedro.

salita
‘Pedro speaks/spoke in a whisper.’
‘Literally: ‘Pedro's speaking is/was (done) in a whisper.’)

pagkilos

‘They are/were moving angrily.
(Literally: ‘Their moving is/was (done) with motions of anger.”)

pagbati

Pangiti ang niya sa akin.

‘He greet(ed) me smilingly.”)

(Literally: His greeting me is/was (done) smilingly.")

pagbaba

‘Rosa is/was descending the stairs as if dancing.’
(literally: ‘Rosa’s descending the stairs is/was (done) as if dancing.’)

paglakad

‘The crab walks/walked sideways.’
(Literally: ‘The crab's walking is/was sideways.”)

§4.8 Pang- adjectives.

The prefix pang- is used to form adjectives of three different types. One of these types, ordinal
numbers, is dealt with in §4.4. The remaining two types, which are dealt with in the present section, may
be called: RESERVATIONAL ADJECTIVES and INSTRUMENTAL ADJECTIVES.

A reservational adjective consists of the prefix pang-, plus, ordinarily, a noun. (See below for
exceptions.) The adjective is often translatable into English by a phrase consisting of ‘for’ plus the
translation-equivalent of the noun that follows pang-: e.g., pangkamay ‘for the hand’ (cf. kamay ‘hand")
pangkape ‘for coffee’ (cf. kape ‘coffee’), pangkumot ‘for a blanket’ (cf. kumor ‘blanket’). The English ‘for’
phrases to which reservational adjectives are equivalent usually have the meaning ‘reserved or intended for
use on/in, etc.’, as in:

Pangkamay ang relos na ito.
‘This watch is for (use on) the hand.”
(ie., ‘This watch is a wristwatch.)

Pangkape ang asukal na ito.
‘This sugar is for (use in) coffee.’

Pangkumot ang lanang ito.
‘This wool is for (use in) a blanket.’

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 219

There is a subclass of reservational adjectives that means ‘reserved or intended to be worn in/at—’, as
in:

Pang-opisina ang damit na ito.
‘This dress is for (wear in) an office.’

In reservational adjectives belonging to this subclass, the prefix may be followed by a noun representing a
place, event, time or activity: e.g., pang-opisina ‘for (wear in) an office’ (cf. opisina ‘office’), pangkasal ‘for
(wear at) a wedding’ (cf. kasal ‘wedding’), panggabi ‘for (wear in) the nighttime’ (cf. gabi ‘night’), pantenis
‘for (wear in playing) tennis’ (cf. tenis ‘tennis’ — see below for an explanation of the pan- form of the
prefix). In a few cases, what follows the prefix is not a noun but a verb base: e.g., pansimba ‘for (wear in)
church’ (cf. magsimba ‘go to church’). Some pang- adjectives used in the meaning ‘for wear infat’ may have
other reservational meanings as well. Thus pang-opisina may have the general meaning ‘for use in an office’
as well as the meaning ‘for wear in an office’:

Pang-opisina ang mesang ito.
‘This table is for (use in) an office.”

Other pang- adjectives used in the meaning ‘for wear in/at’ have only this meaning. Pansimba, for example,
can mean only ‘for wear in church’.

Pansimba ito.
‘This is for (wear in) church.”

(The meaning ‘for use in church’ is expressed by (para) sa simbahan, as in (Para) sa simbahan ang kandilang
ito. ‘This candle is for (use in) church’. As is noted in §4.20, subsection (1), reservational phrases
introduced by (para) sa are common translation equivalents of English ‘for’-phrases, in which ‘for’ connotes
‘reserved or intended for’. In some cases either a (para) sa phrase or a pang- adjective may be used to
translate the ‘for’ phrase. Thus ‘The sugar is for coffee’ may be either (Para) sa kape ang asukal or Pangkape
ang asukal.\n other cases, only a (para) sa phrase may be used.)

As was noted above, the pang- of a reservational adjective is occasionally followed by a verb base
rather than a noun. It may also be followed by a cardinal or ordinal number (cf. §4.4). A reservational
adjective consisting of pang- plus a cardinal number usually has the meaning ‘for the use of * ¢.g.,

 

Pandalawa ang mesang ito.
‘This table is for (the use of) two.”

(Note that the reservational adjective pandalawa ‘for two’ differs in form from the pang- ordinal number
pangalawa ‘second’.) The cardinal number may, in turn, function as the first element of a modification
construction, in which case it is followed by the linker na/-ng plus a noun: e.g.,

Pandalawang tao ang mesang ito.
‘This table is for two people.”

A reservational adjective consisting of pang- plus an ordinal number usually has the meaning ‘for use
as___’, and usually functions as the first element of a modification construction: e.g.,

Pang-ikalawang

premyo ang librong ito.
Pampangalawang
‘This book is for (use as) the second prize.”

220 CHAPTER 4

The prefix pang- in reservational adjectives has three variant forms: pam- /pam/, pan- /pan/, and
pang- {pan{. Pam- occurs if the following consonant is labial, pan- if the following consonant is dental or
alveolar pang- elsewhere. Examples of the pam and pan- forms of the prefix are:

pamparti ‘for a party”
pambata ‘for a child’
pantatlo “for three’
pandalawa ‘for two’
pansopas ‘for soup”
panlima ‘for five’

An instrumental adjective consists of the prefix pang- plus a verb base or of pang- plus the
indirect-action prefix pa- cf. §5.12 plus a verb base. The adjective has the meaning ‘for use in
performing’ the action designated by the related actor-focus verb (cf. §2.9) formed with the same base. (It
may be noted that, from the point of view of meaning, instrumental adjectives are quite similar to
reservational adjectives. There is, however, a formal reason for separating the two — see below.) For
example, the instrumental adjective panghabi means ‘for use in weaving’ (cf. humabi ‘weave’), the
instrumental adjective panghukay means ‘for use in digging’ (cf. humukay ‘dig’), etc. The actor-focus verb
to which the instrumental adjective is related may be an -wm- verb (examples above), a mag- verb (panluto
‘used in cooking’ — cf. magluto ‘cook’), a mang- verb (pangusina ‘used in cooking,’ — cf. mangusina ‘cook’),
Or a magpe- indirect-action verb (pampatulog ‘used for putting to sleep’ — cf. magpatulog ‘put to sleep’).

The instrumental adjective may be followed by the same object and/or directional and/or secondary-actor
complements as the verb: ¢.g.,

Panghabi ng tela ito.
‘This is used for weaving cloth.’

(cf. Humabi ng tela ang babae.
‘The woman wove cloth.’)

Panghukay sa lupa ito.
‘This is used for digging in the ground.”
(cf. Humukay sa lupa si Juan.

‘Juan dug in the ground.’)

Pampatulog ng pasyente ito.

‘This is used for putting a patient to sleep.”

(cf. Nagpatulog ng pasyente ang duktor.
‘The doctor put the patient to sleep.’)

When the verb related to an instrumental adjective is an -um- or mag- verb whose base begins with one
of the phenemes /p/, /t/, /s/, or /k/, there are usually two freely alternating ways of forming the adjective.
One of these ways is identical with the way in which reservational adjectives of similar composition are
formed (see above). That is, the prefix assumes one of three shapes: /pam/ before /p/, /pan/ before /t/ or
{s/, /panf before {k/. The alternative formation is not shared by the reservational adjectives. In this
formation, the initial base consonant is replaced by its homorganic nasal counterpart — /p/ by /m/, /t/ or /s/
by /n/, /k/ by /n/ — and the final nasal of the prefix is simultaneously lost. Examples of the alternation are:

pampunas

‘for use in wiping’ (cf. magpunas ‘wipe’)
pamunas
pantakip

‘for use in covering” (cf. magtakip ‘wipe’)
panakip

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 221

pansuklay

‘for use in combing’ (cf. magsuklay ‘comb’)
panuklay
pangkuha

‘for use in getting” (cf. kumuha ‘get’)
panguha

When the verb base used in the instrumental adjective begins with a consonant other than /p/, /t/, /s/,
or /k/, and the related verb is an -ta7~ or mag: verb, the formation of the adjective is identical with that of
the reservational adjectives, as described above. (The prefix is /pam/ before a labial, /pan/ before a dental or
alveolar, /pan/ elsewhere.) Some examples are:

pambili ‘for use in buying’ (cf. bumili buy’)
pandagdag ‘for use in adding’ (cf. magdagdag ‘add’)
panluto ‘for use in cooking’ (cf. magluto ‘cook’)
pang-ahit ‘for use in shaving’ (cf. mag-ahit ‘shave’)
pangguhit ‘for use in drawing’ (cf. gumuhit ‘draw’)
panghabi ‘for use in weaving’ (cf. humabi ‘weave’)
pangmumog “for use in gargling’ (cf. magmumog ‘gargle’)
pangnobena ‘for use in performing novenas’ (cf. magnobena ‘perform novenas’)
pangnguya ‘for use in chewing’ (cf. ngumuya ‘chew’)
pangwalis ‘for use in sweeping” (cf. magwalis ‘sweep’)
pangyupi ‘for use in denting’ (cf. yumupi ‘dent’)

When the verb related to an instrumental adjective is a mang- verb, the instrumental adjective is
formed by prefixing /pam/ to a formation in which /p/ replaces the initial /m/ of the verb affix. Thus
pampamili ‘for use in shopping’ is the instrumental adjective that corresponds to mamili ‘shop’ (base, bili),
and pampangahoy ‘for use in gathering wood’ is the instrumental adjective that corresponds to mangahoy
‘gather wood.” In some cases, the initial /pam/ of the formation is optionally deletable. Thus the
instrumental adjective that corresponds to mamalengke ‘go marketing’ (base, palengke) may be either
pampamalengke or pamalengke ‘for use in going marketing’, and the instrumental adjective that
corresponds to mangusina ‘cook’ may be either pampangusina or pangusina ‘for use in cooking’.

Where the verb related to an instrumental adjective is a magpa- verb, the adjective is formed by
replacing the mag- of the prefix with pam. Thus pampakain ‘for use in feeding’ is the instrumental adjective
that corresponds to magpakain ‘feed’, and pampadala ‘for use in sending’ is the instrumental adjective that
corresponds to magpadala ‘send’.

84.9. Adjectives expressing inclination.

Inclination to perform an activity is often expressed in Tagalog by an adjective-plus-basic-form-com-
plement construction introduced by mahilig ‘fond of: ¢.g., mahilig humakad ‘fond of walking’ (cf. §4.17).
In addition to this adjective-plus-complement construction, there are at least four types of one-word
adjective formations that express inclination to perform an activity. These adjective formations are often
translatable by ‘fond of —_ jing’, ‘inclined to’, or ‘always — ing’ in English. The formations
are: (1) pala- ADJECTIVES, (2) mapag-ADJECTIVES, (3) mapang- ADJECTIVES, and (4) ma-...-in
ADJECTIVES.

(1) pala- ADJECTIVES. Pala- adjectives consist of the prefix pala- /pala/ and a base that also occurs

as the base of a vesb. In most cases, the verb in which the base occurs is an -wm- verb:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

222 CHAPTER 4

palabasa ‘fond of reading’ (cf. bumasa ‘read")
palakopya ‘fond of copying* (cf. kumopya “copy’)
palakuha ‘fond of taking’ (cf. kumuha ‘take’)
palalakad ‘fond of walking’ (cf. lumakad ‘walk’
palapunta ‘fond of going" (cf. pumunta “go’)
palatawa ‘fond of laughing’ (cf. tumawa ‘laugh’)

If the base of the related verb has a long vowel in its penultimate syllable, the pala- adjective often has two
freely alternating pronunciations: one in which the length of the penultimate vowel is retained, the other
in which it is lost. Thus, palabasa is either /palaba‘sah/ or /palabasah/ (cf. bu:masa fouma‘sah/), and
palalakad is either /palala‘kad/ or /palalakad/ (cf. lumaKad /luma‘kad/). If the base of the related verb lacks
inherent length, so does the base of the pala- adjective. Thus palapunta is pronounced /palapuntah/ (cf.
pumunta {pumuntah/).

Apart from bases of -um- verbs, certain other bases occur in pala- adjectives. Among these are at least
two ma- verb bases: ligo (palaligo {palali‘go’} ‘fond of bathing’ — cf. maligo {mali-go’f ‘bathe’) and tulog
(palatulog |palatu(-)log/‘fond of sleeping’ — cf. matulog /matu'log/ ‘sleep’). Some speakers also use certain
mag- verb bases in pala- adjectives: e.g., aral (palaaral /pala’a(:)ral/ ‘fond of studying’ — cf. mag-aral
{mag’a‘tal/ ‘study’), bintang (palabintang {palabintan/ ‘fond of blaming’ — cf. magbintang {magbintan/
‘blame’), luro (palaluto {palalu(-)to’/ ‘fond of cooking’ — cf. magluto {maglu‘to’/ ‘cook’), and sigarilyo
(palasigarilyo jpalasigari lyoh{ ‘fond of smoking (cigarettes)’ — cf. magsigarilyo {magsigari‘lyoh/ ‘smoke
(cigarettes)’). But usage is divided in most such cases, with the majority of speakers either preferring
mapag- formations (see below to the pala- formations, or using mapag- formations exclusively.

(2) Mapag- adjectives. Mapag- adjectives consist of the prefix mapag- {mapag/ and a base that also
occurs as the base of a mag- verb. Some examples are:

mapagkape ‘fond of drinking coffee” (cf. magkape ‘drink coffee’)
mapagdala ‘fond of bringing’ (cf. magdala ‘bring’)
mapagluto ‘fond of cooking’ (cf. magluto ‘cook’)
mapagmarunong _—‘fond of pretending to be wise’ (cf. magmarunong ‘pretend

to be wise’)
mapagseda ‘fond of wearing silk’ (cf. magseda ‘wear silk’)
mapagtsinelas ‘fond of wearing slippers’ (cf. magtsinelas ‘wear slippers’)

The pronunciation of the base in the mapag- adjective is identical with its pronunciation in the mag- verb.
Thus:

{mapagkapeh/ (/magkapeh/)
{mapaglu‘to’/ (/maglu:to’/)

(3) Afapang- adjectives. Mapang- adjectives consist of the prefix mapang- and a base that also occurs
as the base of a mang- verb. The same assimilatory changes that occur in the verbs (cf. §5.2, subsection
(12)) occur in the adjectives. Thus, for example, the initial /p/ of the base pintas is replaced by /m/ (with
simultaneous loss of the nasal of the prefix) in mapamintas ‘fond of criticizing’ (cf. mamintas ‘criticize’),
and the initial /t/ of the base takot is replaced by /n/ (with simultaneous loss of the prefix nasal) in
mapanakot ‘fond of frightening’ (cf. manakot ‘frighten’). Some further examples are:

mapanligalig ‘fond of causing worry’ (cf. manligalig ‘cause worry’)
mapanlundag ‘fond of jumping upon’ (cf. manlundag ‘jump upon’)
mapanggulo ‘fond of causing disturbance’ (cf. manggulo ‘cause disturbance’)
mapanghiya ‘fond of embarrassing’ (cf. manghiya ‘embarrass’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 223

The pronunciation of the base in the mapang- adjective is identical with its pronunciation in the
mang- verb. Thus:

/mapamintas/ (/mamintas/)
/mapana‘kot/ (/mana:kot/)

(4) Ma-. . .-in adjectives. Ma-. . .-in adjectives consist of the prefix ma- /ma/, a base that also occurs as
the base of ma- verb, and the suffix -in /in/. (The ma- verbs whose bases occur in ma-. . .-in adjectives all
belong to the class of directional ma- verbs whose dircctional-focus counterparts are formed with
ka-.. an: cf, §5.4, class A.2). Some examples are:

mainggitin ‘inclined to be envious’ (cf. maingit ‘be envious’)
mainipin ‘inclined to be bored’ (cf. mainip ‘be bored’)
magalitin ‘inclined to be angry” (cf. magalit ‘be angry’)
matakutin ‘inclined to be frightened’ (cf. matakot ‘be frightened’)
matuwain ‘inclined to be amused’ (cf. matuwa ‘be amused’)
mayamutin ‘inclined to be annoyed’ (cf. mayamot ‘be annoyed’)

The last vowel of the base is always long in the adjective formation; the penultimate vowel is also long if it
is syllable-final, but short if it is not syllable-final. Thus:

{maingi-tin/ (/ma’ingit/)
/ma‘i'ni*pin{ (/ma‘inip/)
{maga'li‘tinf (/maga’lit/)

Many speakers also use a formation in which a duplicating syllable (consisting of the first consonant
and first vowel of the base) occurs between ma- and the base. Thus, also: eaiinggitin, maiinipin,
magagalitin, etc. In this formation, both vowels of the base are always short. Some speakers use either a
short or a long vowel in the duplicating syllable: ¢.g.,

/ma’i'ingitin/
/ma’i-’ingitin/

/magagalitin/
/maga‘galitin/

Other speakers use only a short vowel in the duplicating syllable.

For some speakers, the two formations — with and without the duplicating syllable — are in free
alternation in all cases. Other speakers prefer the formation without duplication for some bases, the
formation with duplication for others. And still other speakers use the formation without duplication
almost exclusively, allowing the duplicated formation as an alternant in a few cases only.

All four of the types of adjectives presented in this section may be followed by the same ng-phrase
and/or sa-phrase complements as the verbs to which they are related. For example:

Palabasa ng mga diyaryo si Juan.
‘Juan is fond of reading newspapers.”

(cf. Bumabasa ng mga diyaryo si Juan.
‘Juan reads newspapers.)

Mapagdala ng mga regalo sa kanila si Juan.
‘Juan is fond of bringing presents to them.”

(cf. Nagdadala ng mga regalo sa kanila si Juan.
‘Juan brings presents to them.’)

‘Juan is inclined to be envious of his brother.’

(cf. Naiinggit si Juan sa kapatid niya.
‘Suan is envious of his brother.’)

§4.10. Other derived adjective formations.

A DERIVED ADJECTIVE is an adjective that includes at least one ADJECTIVAL AFFIX and an
ADJECTIVAL BASE. An adjectival affix is a meaningful element that occurs as part of an adjective and
never occurs independently as a distinct word. Adjectival affixes are either PREFIXES or SUFFIXES,
according to whether they precede or follow the base. An adjectival base is a meaningful element within a
derived adjective that may also occur independently (e.g., as a noun or unaffixed adjective) and/or as the
base of another type of formation (e.g., as a verb base).

Many classes of derived adjective formations are dealt with in other sections of this chapter: e.g., ma-
adjectives (§4.3), ordinal numbers (4.4), distributive, restrictive, grouping, and indefinite numerals (4.5),
Pa- adjectives (4.7), pang- adjectives (4.8), adjectives expressing inclination (4.9), pluralized adjectives
(4.11), intensive adjectives (4.12), and moderative adjectives (4.13). The present section provides an
inventory of the more productive of the remaining classes. In the inventory, each class is designated by a
formula in which the symbol ’B’ stands for ‘adjectival base’. The symbol ‘dup,-’ in a formula stands for a
prefix that normally consists of a duplication of the first following consonant and vowel; the symbol
‘dup,-” stands for a prefix that normally consists of a duplication of the first two syllables of the following
base. (For details of the formation of dup,- and dup-, cf. §§5.23 and 5.16, respectively.) Other affixes
are represented in the formulas by their conventional spelling, except that prefixes are followed and
suffixes preceded by a hyphen.

For each class of derived adjectives listed, the class meaning(s), expressed as a function of the
meanings of the bases, and examples with translations are presented. Each example is followed by a
parenthetic citation either of the base alone or of a related formation in which the base occurs. The citation
is of the base alone unless otherwise noted.

Some of the listings include a discussion of pronunciation. Where there is no such discussion, it is to
be understood that there is no inherent length in the affix(es), and that the bases show no phonemic change
from their CITATION FORMS, except for such regular features of Tagalog phonology as the interchanges
of {dj and fr/, /e/ and fi/, or fof and /u/. (The citation form of a base is the form that it has in its
independent occurrence — or, in a few cases, in its occurrence in a related formation. Discussion of
pertinent regular features of Tagalog phonology are to be found in § §1.17, 1.10 and 1.20.)

(1) Bt+-an

Meaning: virtually covered with what the base designates.

Exampkes:

duguan ‘virtually covered with blood’ (dugo ‘blood*)
itiman ‘virtually covered with black’ (itim ‘black’)
pulahan ‘virtually covered with red” (pula ‘red’)
putikan ‘virtually covered with mud’ (putik ‘mud’)
sugatan ‘virtually covered with wounds’ (sugat ‘wound’)
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 225

Pronunciation: No long vowels occur in the derived formations. Any inherently long vowel in the
citation form of the base is shortened. Thus:

{putikan/ ({putik/)
{sugatan{ ({su-gat/)

Remarks: There are a very few adjectives of the shape B + -an in which the base designates a part of
the body. These adjectives mean: having a body-part (the part designated by the base) of unusually large
size: ¢.g., pangahan /panahan/ ‘large-jawed’ (cf. panga {panah/ ‘jaw’).

(2) Bt-in

Meaning: susceptible to, given to, or casily affected by, what the base designates.

Examples:
antukin ‘given to sleepiness’ (antok ‘sleepiness’)
baliktarin ‘reversible’ (baliktad ‘inside out’)
bulutungin ‘susceptible to smallpox’ (bulutong ‘smallpox’)
himatayin ‘tending to faint often’ (himatay ‘faint’)
lagnatin ‘susceptible to fever’ (lagnat ‘fever’)
sipunin ‘susceptible to head colds’ (sipon ‘head cold’)
ubuhin ‘susceptible to chest colds’ (ubo ‘chest cold’)

Pronunciation: All syllable-final base vowels are long in the derived formation, regardless of whether
they are long or short in the citation form of the base. Non-syllable-final base vowels remain short. Thus:

Pantu'kin/ (fantok/)

foa‘likta‘rin/ ({baliktad/)
fou'lu‘tu'nin/ ({bulu‘ton/)
{hitma‘ta‘yin/ ({himatay/)

(3) B+na/-ng + B

Meaning: experiencing in an intense degree the emotion expressed by the base.

Examples:
awang-awa ‘feeling great pity’ (awa ‘pity’)
bagot na bagot ‘very bored’ (bagot ‘boredom’)
habag na habag ‘feeling great pity” (habag ‘pity’)
lugod na lugod ‘very pleased’ (lugod ‘pleasure’)
lungkot na lungkot ‘very sad’ (lungkot ‘sadness’)
sindak na sindak ‘very surprised’ (sindak ‘surprise’)
suklam na suklam “very disgusted” (suklam ‘disgust’)

Remarks: The element that connects the two occurrences of the base is the linker na/-ng, whose
characteristics are given in detail in §3.11.

These fonnations are structurally similar to certain intensive formations dealt with in
$4.12: formations involving an unaffixed adjective followed by na/-ng and a repetition of the adjective.
The formations illustrated above differ from the formations presented in 4.12 only in the fact that their
bases — awa, bagot, etc. — do not occur independently as unaffixed adjectives.

(4) ka- + dup,-+ B

CHAPTER 4

Meaning: causing or serving to produce, in an extreme degree, what the base designates.

Examples:

kagalang-galang ‘inspiring great respect’
kahila-hilakbot ‘extremely shocking’
kaibig-ibig ‘adorable’
kalugud-lugod ‘delightful’
kapani-paniwala ‘very plausible”
kapuri-puri ‘highly praiseworthy’
katawa-tawa ‘hilarious’

kawili-wili ‘delightful’
kayamut-yamot ‘extremely boring’

(5) ma- + B+-an

(galang ‘respect’)
(hilakbot *shock’)
(ibig ‘love’)

(lugod ‘satisfaction’)
(paniwala ‘belief)
(puri ‘praise’)

(tawa ‘laughter’)
(wili ‘enjoyment’)
(yamot ‘boredom’)

Meaning: (a) requiring the quality designated by the base; (b) characterized by a mutual

manifestation of the quality designated by the base.

Examples:

(a) mabilisan ‘requiring speed”
madalian ‘requiring speed’
matagalan ‘requiring slowness’

‘characterized by
mutual closeness (of competition)’

(b) mahigpitan

mahirapan ‘characterized by mutual difficulty’
malakasan ‘characterized by mutual vigorousness’
masinsinan ‘characterized by

mutual closeness (of competition)’

(Some examples of the above formations in sentences are:

(a) Mabilisan
ang trabahong ito.

Matagalan
speed.”
‘This work requires
slowness.”
(b) Mahigpitan
ang labanan.
Malakasan

closely competitive.”
‘The fighting was
vigorous on both/all sides.")

(bilis ‘speed")
(dali ‘speed")
(tagal ‘slowness”)

(higpit ‘closeness

(of competition)’)
(hirap ‘difficulty’)
(lakas ‘vigorousness’)
(sinsin ‘closeness

(of competition)’)

Pronunciation: The vowel of ma- is long. All syllable-final base vowels are long in the derived

formation; non-syllable-final base vowels are short. Thus:

/marbiclisan/ ({bilis/)
/ma‘hi‘ra‘pan/ (/hirap/)
/marsinsi-nan/ (/sinsin/)

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 227

(6) maka- + B

Meaning: in favor of, os fond of, what the base designates.

Examples:
maka-ama ‘close to (one’s) father’ (ama ‘father’)
makabago ‘progressive’ (bago ‘new’)
makabayan ‘patriotic’ (bayan ‘country’)
maka-Garcia ‘pro-Garcia’ (Garcia (a surname))
maka-Hapon ‘pro-Japancse’ (Hapon ‘Japan’)
maka-ina ‘close to (one’s) mother’ (ina ‘mother’)
makaluma ‘conservative’ (luma ‘old’)

Remarks: Any surname, or any geographic name designating a country, region, city, etc., may occur as a
base in this formation; the resultant adjective in these cases normally denotes partisanship.

dup,-+ ka- )
(7) na- + +B
ka- + dup,- \
Meaning: causing or serving to produce what the base designates.
Examples:
nakakaantok
‘causing sleepiness’ (antok ‘sleepiness’)
nakaaantok
nakakabihag )
‘captivating’ (bihag ‘captive’)
nakabibihag {
nakakahiya }
‘embarrassing’ (hiya ‘embarrassment’)
nakahihiya j
nakakatakot )
‘frightening’ (takot ‘fear’)
nakatatakot j
nakakatuwa
‘laughable’ (tuwa ‘laughter’)
nakatutuwa
nakakaubo )
‘causing coughing’ (ubo ‘cough’)
nakauubo j

Pronunciation: The vowels of na- and ka- are short; the vowel of the duplicating syllable is long (cf.
§5.16); the base retains its citation pronunciation. Thus:

{naka*ka’antok/
(/antok/)

{naka‘a*’antok/

{naka‘kabi‘hag/ )
(foichag/
Jnakabi-bi-hag/ (

/naka‘kahiya’/ }
(hiya)
{nakahi-hiya’/ \

Remarks: The two formations (with the duplicating syllable immediately before or immediately after
ka-) alternate freely in all cases.

In some cases, the adjective formations are homonymous with the imperfective forms of maka- verbs
(cf. §5.20). Thus nakakabihag /nakabibihag also occurs as the imperfective form of the verb makabihag
‘succeed in capturing.” The homonymous verbs differ from the adjectives not only in meaning, but in the
fact that, being transitive, they accept ng-phrase or sa-phrase complements. Compare, for example, the verb

in:
{rs
Lagi silang nakakabihag } | maraming kaaway.

sa

‘They always succeed in capturing many enemies.”
and the adjective in:
Lagi silang nakakabihag. ‘They are always captivating.’

There are also many adjective formations that are not matched by homonymous verb forms. Thus
there are no such verbs as *makaantok or *makahiya from which to derive imperfective forms
homonymous with the adjectives nakakaantok/nakaaantok and nakakaniya/nakahihiya.

na- + dup,- + Kapang- )
(8) +B

na- + Kapang- + dup,-{

Meaning: causing or producing the state designated by the mang- verb formed with the same base.
Examples: (Citations in parentheses are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

nakakapamutla )

‘causing temporary paleness’ (mamutila ‘be temporarily pale’)
nakapamumutla {
nakakapanlambot )

‘causing temporary weakness’ (manlambot ‘be temporarily weak’)
nakapanlalambot j
nakakapanliit

‘causing one to feel small’ (manliit ‘feel small’)
nakapanililiit
nakakapanghina

‘causing temporary weakness” (manghina ‘be temporarily weak’)
nakapanghihina
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 229

nakakapanghinayang }

‘causing regret’ (manghinayang ‘feel regret’)
nakapanghihinayang f
nakakapangalog

‘causing trembling (of the knees)’ (mangalog ‘tremble (in the knees)’)
nakapangangalog (

Pronunciation: The vowels of na- and kapang- are short; the vowel of the duplicating syllable is long.
The same assimilatory changes (of the initial base consonant and/or the final nasal of the prefix) that occur
in the related mang- verb occur in the adjective. Vowel length, if any, in the base is retained. Thus:

{naka*kapamutla’/ } ({mamutla’/)
/nakapamu‘mutla’/ (cf. putla /putla’/‘paleness’)

/naka‘kapanhina‘yan/ (/manhina:yan/)
/nakapanhi‘hinayan/ (cf. hinayang /hina-yan/‘regret’)

Remarks: The two formations (with the duplicating syllable immediately before or immediately after
Kapang-) alternate frecly in all cases.

(9) naka- + B
Meaning: (a) in the position or state that results from performing the action designated by the -wm-

verb formed with the same base; (b) wearing the article designated by the base.
Examples: (Citations in parentheses for examples (a) are the basic forms of the related verbs.)

(a) nakaharap ‘facing’ (humarap ‘face’)
nakahiga ‘lying down’ (humiga ‘lie down’)
nakatayo ‘standing’ (tumayo ‘stand’)
nakatira ‘living (in/at)’ (tumira ‘live (in/at)’)
nakaupo *seated* (umupo ‘sit’)

(b) naka-amerikana ‘wearing a coat* (amerikana ‘coat’)
nakabaro ‘wearing a dress” (baro ‘dress’)
nakaluksa ‘wearing mourning’ (luksa ‘mourning (apparel)’)
nakasalamin ‘wearing glasses’ (salamin ‘glasses’)
nakasapatos ‘wearing shoes’ (sapatos ‘shoes’)

84.11. Pluralization of adjectives.

Most adjectives other than numbers may, like unmarked nouns (cf. §3.9), be explicitly pluralized by
the plural marker mga (/manah/), which normally precedes what it pluralizes. As in the case of nouns,
explicit pluralization of adjectives is in general optional. Thus either a pluralized or a non-pluralized
adjective may occur as predicate with a plural topic, as (nominalized) topic with a plural predicate, etc.:

Mga tamad }

sila.
Tamad j
‘They're lazy.’
{ mga tamad.
Sila ang
l tamad.

‘They’re the lazy ones.’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
 

230 CHAPTER 4

Many mia- adjectives (cf. §4.3) may be pluralized not only by sga, but also by the use of a distinctive
plural formation. (Sometimes both mga and the plural formation are used — see below.) In this formation, a
duplicating syllable occurs between ma- and the ma- adjective base. (The formation of the duplicating
syllable follows the rules given for dup,- in $3.7.) Some examples are:

Singular Plural

maayos ‘orderly’ maaayos /ma’a’a‘yos/
mabagal ‘slow’ mababagal /mababa‘gal/
mabuti “good” mabubuti /mabubu'tih/
maganda ‘beautiful’ magaganda /magagandah/
malaki ‘big’ malalaki /malalakih/
maliit ‘little’ maliliit /malili’it/

maswerte ‘lucky’ masuswerte /masuswe'rteh/
matyaga ‘persevering’ matityaga /matityaga’/
mayaman ‘rich’ mayayaman /mayaya*man/

Certain ma- adjectives are not pluralizable in this way. These are the majority of ma- adjectives whose
base is a CONCRETE noun: that is, a noun representing something concrete or visible. Examples of ma-
adjectives that do not occur in pluralized forms are: maalikabok ‘dusty’ (base: alikabok ‘dust’), madahon
"leafy’ (base: dahon ‘leaf), mailaw ‘full of light’ (base: ilaw ‘light’), matao ‘full of people’ (base: tao
“‘person’). (A few ma- adjectives with concrete- noun bases, however, do have plural forms: e.g.,
manuni>marunumi ‘ditty’ (base: dumi ‘dirt’); matinik>matitinik ‘thomy’ (base: tinik ‘thorn’).)

The use of pluralized ma- adjectives is in general optional:

Maganda
ang mga bulaklak.
Magaganda
‘The flowers are beautiful.”
mayaman.
Sila ang
mayayaman.

‘They are the rich ones.’

When mma- adjectives occur after the plural marker mga, however, the use of the pluralized form of the
adjective is obligatory in some contexts, for some speakers. Thus:

Mga magaganda ang (mga) bulaklak.
Sila ang mga mayayaman.

not, for most speakers:

*Mga maganda ang (mga) bulaklak.
*Sila ang mga mayaman.

Some speakers, however, occasionally use the non-pluralized form after mga, especially when the ma-
adjective is used as a modifier: e.g., mga magandang bulaklak (as well as mga magagandang bulaklak)
“beautiful flowers’.

Restrictions on the use of mga with a non-pluralized ma- adjective do not apply in the case of ma-
adjectives whose roots are concrete nouns. (As was mentioned above, these adjectives lack an explicitly
pluralized form.) Thus:

Gusto ko ang mga madahon.
‘I like the leafy ones.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 233

In a modification construction involving a pluralizable ma- adjective followed by the linker ma/-ng (cf.

§3.11), a number of alternative pluralizations may occur. Plurality may be expressed by duplication of the
adjective, by mga, or by both, and mga may occur either before the adjective or after the linker. The
alternatives are illustrated below:

Mga masisipag na bata

Mga masipag na bata

Masisipag na bata ang mga kapatid ko.
Masisipag na mga bata

Masipag na mga bata

‘My brothers are industrious children.”

(Mga may also occur either before the adjective or after the linker in modification constructions involving
adjectives other than ma- adjectives. Thus: mga bagong libro or bagong mga libro ‘new books’.)

Where a modification construction (except for a modification construction that involves a cardinal
number) occurs as predicate opposite a pluralized topic, pluralization of the construction is obligatory if
the topic refers to a specific group of things or people:

Mga magagaling na komersyante iyong mga Intsik doon.
‘Those Chinese over there are good businessmen.”

When a non-pluralized modification construction occurs opposite a pluralized topic, the topic has a
generalized meaning:

Magaling na komersyante ang mga Intsik.
‘The Chinese (in general) are good businessmen.”

(There are certain unaffixed adjectives that have distinctive plural formations in specific
constructions: after the intensive prefix napaka-, after the prefix ka- in certain phrases expressing similarity
and in exclamations. The pluralization of these adjectives is presented in connection with the pertinent
constructions in § §4.12, 4.18, and 4.24.)

§4.12. Intensification of adjectives.

An intense degree of the quality denoted by an adjective (equivalent to English ‘very’ plus an
adjective) is frequently expressed by a construction in which the adjective is repeated, with the linker
najf-ng (cf. §3.11) preceding the second occurrence. The members of many different classes of adjectives
occur in this construction, among them: unaffixed adjectives (§4.2), ma- adjectives (4.3), adjectives
expressing inclination (4.9), and various other classes of derived adjectives (§4.10). An adjective given an
intensified meaning by repetition may occur in all the same sentence positions as the non-intensified
adjective. Some examples are:

Pagod na pagod ako.
‘Lam very tired.’

Sino ang matabang-mataba?
“Who’s the very fat one?’

May mga batang palabasang-palabasa sa klase.
‘There are some children who are very fond of reading in the class.”

Gumamot siya ng mga sipuning-sipunin.
‘He treated the ones who were very susceptible to head colds.’

Mahilig na mahilig magbesbol sina Joe.
‘Joe and his friends are very fond of playing baseball.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
232 CHAPTER 4

All ma- adjective bases and many unaffixed adjectives also occur in a formation of intensive meaning
in which they are preceded by the prefix napaka- {na:paka/. Napaka- replaces the ma- of ma- adjectives, and
precedes unaffixed adjectives. Thus:

maganda ‘beautiful’ > napakaganda ‘very beautiful”
tamad ‘lazy* > napakatamad — ‘very lazy.”

Members of the subclass of unaffixed adjectives that correspond to nouns with loss of penultimate
vowel length (cf. §4.2) do not occur in intensive formations with napaka-. Thus, there are no intensive
napaka- formations involving unaffixed adjectives such as galit /galit/ ‘angry’ (cf. galit /ga‘lit/ ‘anger’),
pagod |pagod/ ‘tired’ (cf. pagod /pagod/ ‘tiredness’), etc. (A few adjectives belonging to this subclass do
occur with napeka-, but with a shifted, rather than an intensified, meaning. Thus gutor: /gutom/ ‘hungry’
(cf. gutom /gu:tom/ ‘hunger’) occurs with napaka-, but the meaning of napakagutom is ‘greedy’, rather than
‘very hungry’.) There are also certain other unaffixed adjectives (e.g., bukas ‘open’, muti ‘small’) that fail
to occur with napaka-, but most other unaffixed adjectives do occur in napaka- formations.

A sentence-initial adjective intensified by uapaka- sometimes requires, and almost always allows, the
replacement of the topic ang phrase by a ng phrase. This replacement is obligatory whenever the
sentence-initial intensified adjective is itself the predicate (i.e., is not a modifier). Thus:

Napakaganda ng baro.
‘The dress is very beautiful.”

not:

*Napakaganda ang baro.

(Note, however, that the ang-phrase is retained when the topic precedes the predicate with ay inversion or
contrastive inversion — cf. §7.2:

Ang baro’y napakaganda.
‘The dress is very beautiful.’

Ang baro napakaganda.
‘The dress is very beautiful.” )

Replacement of the topic ang phrase by a ng phrase is also obligatory when an adjective intensified by
napaka- occurs in the predicate before a basic-form complement (cf. §4.17):

Napakatamad (na) magluto ng babae.
‘The woman is very lazy about cooking.’

When a sentence-initial adjective intensified by napaka- is used as a modifier, the replacement of the
topic ang phrase by a ng phrase is obligatory in some cases, optional in others. The replacement is
obligatory if the topic is expressed by a personal pronoun or a personal name, a singular deictic pronoun, a
singular unmarked noun or a singular (nominalized) adjective. Thus:

niya.

ni Pedro.
Napakabait na bata( noon.

ng kapatid ko.

“Pedro

‘That one is a very good child.’
‘My brother
‘The little one

nila.
Napakababait na bata
nina Pedro.

‘They )
ase very good children.”
“Pedro and his friends j

The replacement is optional when the topic is expressed by a pluralized deictic, unmarked noun, or
adjective, or by a nominalized verbal or adjective phrase. Thus:

iyon.
ang
Napakababait na bata mga kapatid ko.
ng
maliliit.
“Those
‘My brothers are very good children.’
‘The little ones
ang gumawa noon.
Napakabait na bata
ng nasa harap.
‘The one who did that
is a very good child.’

‘The one in front

(When napakarami ‘very many’ is used attributively in predicate position before a nominalized verbal
or adjective-phrase topic, there is no replacement of the topic ang phrase by a ng phrase:

Napakaraming libro ang nasa kahon.
“What’s in the box is a great many books.’)

Any adjective that may be intensified by napaka- may also be intensified by a construction involving
kay or the prefix pagka- /pagka‘/ plus a disyllabic duplicating prefix. (The formation of the duplicating
prefix follows the rules given for dup2- in §5.16.)

The use of the intensive constructions with Xay and pagka- in intensified exclamations is discussed in
§4.24. Some other uses are illustrated below:

kay laki-laki?
Nakita mo ba iyong asong
pagkalaki-laki?
“Did you see that very big dog?”
kay lakas-lakas.
Kumanta si Maria nang
pagkalakas-lakas.

Maria sang very loudly.’

234 CHAPTER 4

Most ma- adjective bases also occur in an intensive construction in which they are preceded by the
sequence ubod ng (literally, ‘core of). For example:

Ubod ng bait ang aming tatay.
“Our father is very kind.”

Si Juan ang sumulat ng liham na ubod ng haba.
‘The one who wrote a very long letter is Juan.’

Similar constructions with hari ng (literally, ‘king of) and ulo ng (literally, ‘head of) occur in a few fixed
phrases: e.g., hari ng yabang ‘very conceited’, ulo ng yaman ‘very rich’.

A good many unaffixed adjectives occur in an intensive formation involving a disyllabic duplicating
prefix (cf. the presentation of dup3-, §5.16.) Examples are:

bali-baliktad ‘all topsy-turvy” (cf. baliktad ‘upside down’)
basag-basag ‘broken to smithereens’ (cf. basag ‘broken’)
butas-butas ‘full of holes’ (cf. butas ‘having a hole’)
hiwa-hiwalay ‘thoroughly scattered” (cf. hiwalay ‘separated’)
labis-labis ‘thoroughly excessive’ (cf. labis *excessive’)
punit-punit ‘thoroughly torn’ (cf. punit ‘torn’)

sira-sira ‘thoroughly ruined’ (cf. sira ‘ruined’)

(If the underlying adjective contains an inherently long vowel, the vowel length is in some cases retained in

the intensive formation, in others lost. Thus: /la’bisla‘bis/ (cf. /la‘bis/), but /punitpunit/ (cf. /pu'nit/).)
This duplicated intensive formation, in addition to the meaning of intensification, always carries some

plural meaning as well. The plural meaning may be a matter of a plural referent for the adjective — e.g.,

Basag-basag ang mga pinggan.
‘The plates are broken to smithereens.”

— or it may be a matter of a single referent that shows many instances of the quality denoted by the
adjective —e.g.,

Butas-butas ang medyas ko.
‘My stocking is full of holes.’

(Most of the duplicated formations that occur as intensive adjectives also occur in intensive magka- + dup2-
verbs — cf. §5.16, subsection (1.d).)

Finally, an adjective may be intensified by a preceding or following adjective of intensive meaning,
the two being joined by the linker na/-ng. The most common intensive adjectives are: ubha, masyado,
totoo, and tunay. Lubha and masyado mean, respectively, ‘serious’ and ‘excessive’. When they are used as
intensifiers with another adjective, they frequently have the meaning ‘too’ or ‘terribly’. Totoo and muiay
both mean ‘true’. When they are used as intensifiers, they frequently have the meaning ‘really’. Some
examples are:

Lubhang kawawa )

ang mga nasunugan.
Kawawang lubha
‘The fire victims are terribly pitiful.’

Masyadong mahal

ang kuwintas.
Mahal na masyado
‘The necklace is too expensive.”

Pagod na totoo j

Tunay na masarap |

Masarap na tunay \

‘This adobo is really delicious.’

The impersonal adjective talaga ‘it is true’ (which differs from Jubha, etc. in that it never accepts a topic)
may also be used as an intensifier, in which case it is similar in meaning to fotoo and tunay:

Talagang masaya )
ang anihan.

Masayang talaga j

‘The harvest is really fun.’

Ma- adjectives pluralized by duplication (cf. §4.11) may occur in any one of the intensive
constructions discussed above, except for the kay and pagka- intensive formations (and the duplicated
intensive formation, in which only unaffixed adjectives occur). Thus:

Mababait na mababait sila.
‘They are very kind.”

Napakabibigat ng mga maleta.
‘The bags are very heavy.’

Ubod ng lalakas ang boses nila.
‘Their voices are very loud.”

Talagang mayayaman ang mga doktor.
‘The doctors are really rich."

Unaffixed adjectives intensified by napaka- also have a distinctive plural formation, which involves
the insertion of a duplicating syllable between napaka- and the adjective itself. (The formation of the
duplicating syllable follows the rules given for dup,- in §3.7.) Some examples are:

Singular Plural

napakabago ‘very new’ Napakababago
napakaberde ‘very green’ napakabiberde
napakahinog ‘very ripe’ napakahihinog
napakatamad ‘very lazy’ napakatatamad

It should be noted that, while ma- adjectives may be pluralized regardless of whether or not they are
intensified, unaffixed adjectives are pluralizable only when they are intensified by napaka- (or when they
occur in certain phrases expressing similarity or in exclamations — cf. § §4.18 and 4.24). Thus there is a

magaganda ‘beautiful (plural)’ that corresponds to napakagaganda ‘very beautiful (plural)’ but no *babago
that corresponds to napakababago ‘very new (plural)’.

§4.13. Moderation of adjectives.

A moderate degree of the quality expressed by an adjective (equivalent to English ‘rather’ or
‘somewhat’ plus adjective) may be indicated by preceding the adjective with medyo, or by following the
adjective with the phrase nang Kaunti:

Medyo gutom
ang lahat.
Gutom nang kaunti
‘Everyone is rather hungry.’
Medyo magugulo
ang mga bata.
Magugulo nang kaunti

‘The children are somewhat troublesome."

medyo payat?
Sino iyong babaeng

payat nang kaunti
‘Who is that rather thin woman’

Most ?a- adjectives also occur in a moderative formation involving a disyllabic duplicating prefix, the
duplicating syllables occurring between ma- and the base itself. (The formation of the duplicating syllables
follows the rules given for dup2- in §5.16.) No inherently long vowels occur in duplicated moderative
formations based on adjectives with disyllabic bases. The only long vowels that may occur in such
formations are instances of compensatory length as the result of the loss of a glottal stop (cf. § 1.12). Thus:

masarap /masarap} ‘tasty’ > masarap-sarap /masarapsarap/
‘rather tasty’

malinis /mali‘nis/ ‘clean’ > malinis-linis /malinislinis/
‘rather clean’

mabisa /mabi-sa’/ ‘effective’ > mabisa-bisa /mabisa‘bisa’/

‘rather effective’

In formations based on adjectives with trisyllabic bases, the second duplicated vowel is always long (cf.
§5.16), and any inherently long vowel in the base itself optionally retains or loses its length. Thus:

masalita /masalita’/ ‘talkative’ ~ masali-salita /masali-salita’/
‘rather talkative’
matalino /matali‘noh/ ‘intelligent’ > matali-talino /matali‘tali‘noh/

{matali‘talinoh/ ‘rather intelligent’

Not all sa- adjectives occur in a duplicated moderative formation. Those that do not are, in general,
the same as those that do not occur in a duplicated plural formation (cf. §4.11): i.e., the majority of ma-
adjectives whose base is a concrete noun. Thus there is no duplicated moderative formation corresponding
to madahon ‘leafy’ (cf. dahon ‘leaf) maginoo ‘gentlemanly’ (cf. ginoo ‘gentleman’), etc.

In addition to ma- adjectives, certain unaffixed adjectives occur in duplicated moderative formations.
Among the duplicated moderative formations involving unaffixed adjectives are the following:

bagu-bago ‘rather new’
basa-basa ‘rather wet’
bata-bata ‘rather young’
buha-buhaghag ‘rather porous’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 237

hinug:hinog “rather ripe”
luma-luma ‘rather old’
mura-mura ‘rather cheap’
pagud-pagod ‘rathes tired’
sanay-sanay ‘rather experienced”
sari-sariwa ‘rather fresh’
tahi-tahimik ‘rather peaceful’

It may be noted that the formation of these duplicated moderatives is identical with that of the intensive
plurals of unaffixed adjectives discussed in §4.12. There is no ambiguity in most cases, however, since very
few unaffixed adjectives occur in both the moderative and the intensive plural formations.

A duplicated moderative formation may occur together with medyo or ng kaunti without any change
of meaning: e.g.,

Maganda-ganda

Medyo maganda-ganda si Maria.
Maganda-ganda nang kaunti {

‘Maria is rather pretty.”

In the case of duplicated moderative formations involving unaffixed adjectives, the use of medyo or nang
kaunti together with the duplicated formation is always preferred, and in some cases may be considered
obligatory. Thus:

Medyo pagud-pagod }
ang nanay.

Pagud-pagod nang kaunti j

‘Mother is a little tired.”

but not normally:
*Pagud-pagod ang nanay.

Apart from its use in expressing a moderate degree of the quality of the underlying adjective, the
duplicated moderative also occurs in a comparative construction which is discussed in §4.15.

§4.14. Comparison of equality.

The comparison of equality (expressed in English by an ‘as ... as’ construction) is expressed in
Tagalog by a construction involving: (1) the prefix (Ka)sing- before an unaffixed adjective or the root of a
ma- adjective, and (2) a ng-phrase complement that expresses the person, thing, etc., to which comparison
is being made. Some speakers ordinarily use only the full form of the prefix, Kasing-, associating the shorter
form, sing-, with poetic language. Other speakers use both sing- and kasing- freely in ordinary conversation.

Any ?a- adjective root may occur with (ka)sing-. Unaffixed adjectives that correspond to nouns with
loss of inherent length (e.g., antok ‘sleepy’, gutom ‘hungry’ — cf. § 4.2) do not occur with (ka }ing-; most
other unaffixed adjectives (e.g., berde ‘green’, tamad ‘lazy’) do occur with (ka)sing-.

Some examples of the (Kajsing- construction are:

(Ka)singluma ng bahay natin ang kamila.
‘Their house is as old as ours.”

(Ka)singganda ni Elena si Maria.
‘Maria is as beautiful as Elena.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
238 , CHAPTER 4

(Ka)singhirap ko siya.
“He is as poor as [ am."

May kakilala ka bang (ka)singbait niya?
“Do you know anyone as kind as he*

The root of a ma- adjective may be pluralized by duplication in the usual way (cf. §4.12) after
(Ka}sing- if several people or things are the subject of comparison:

(Ka)singlalaki nito ang mga iyon.
‘Those are as big as these.”

(Ka)singgaganda sila ng mga artista.
‘They are as beautiful as actresses.”

The ‘reciprocal’ prefix mag- (which also occurs in certain derived nouns — cf. §3.7, subsections (7),
(8), (10), (11)) occurs before (kajsing- (plus an adjective or adjective base), the entire prefix meaning
‘equally’ or ‘equal in’. The mag(ka}sing- formation expresses a quality shared equally by exactly two
people, things, places, etc.:

Mag(ka)singtalino sina Juan at Pedro.
‘Juan and Pedro are equal in intelligence.’

Mag(ka)singbago ang iyong kotse at ang akin.
“Your car and mine are equally new.’

Mag(ka)sing-init ba sa Baguio at Maynila
‘Is it equally hot in Baguio and Manila’

When a quality is expressed as shared cqually by more than two people or things, the ka- of the prefix
magkasing- is duplicated, the vowel of the duplicating syllable being short: ¢.g., smagkakasingtalino
{magkakasingtali:noh/.

Some examples are:

Magkakasingtalino silang lahat.
‘They are all equal in intelligence.”

Magkakasingbago ang tatlong kotse.
‘The three cars are equally new.”

As an alternative to the magkakasing- formation, some speakers use mag(ka sing- plus duplication of the
first consonant and vowel of the following adjective or adjective base, the vowel of the duplicating syllable
being short. For these speakers, muagkasingtatalino /magkasingtatali‘noh/ or magsingtatalino
/magsingtatali‘noh/ may occur as an alternative to magkakasingtalino.

A formation consisting of mag(ka)ing- or magkakasing- plus an adjective or adjective base may be
followed by a ng phrase that expresses the thing with respect to which the quality of the adjective is shared.
For example, mag/ka singganda ng boses might be translated literally as ‘equal in beauty of voice’, or, more
idiomatically, ‘having equally beautiful voices’ or ‘with equally beautiful voices’. Thus:

Humahanap siya ng dalawang batang mag(ka)singganda ng boses.
‘He is looking for two children with equally beautiful voices.”

Some further examples of this construction are:

Magkakasingdumi sila ng mukha.
‘They have equally dirty faces.’

Binigyan ng premyo ang lahat ng magkakasingbuti ng grado. ‘All those with equally good grades were
given a prize.’

§4.15. Comparison of inequality.
English has a number of ways of expressing comparisons of inequality. One of them is simply the
negative of the ‘as .. . as’ comparison of equality:

‘John isn’t as intelligent as Mary’.
Others involve ‘less’, ‘more’, or the suffix ‘-er’ with an adjective (or adverb) followed by ‘than’:

‘John is less intelligent than Mary’.
‘John is more intelligent than Mary’.
“John is smarter than Mary’.

In Tagalog too a comparison of inequality may be expressed by the negative of the
comparison-of-equality construction (cf. § §4.14 and 7.13):

Hindi kasingtalino ni Mary si John.
‘John isn’t as intelligent as Mary.”

This same construction would also be used in most cases to express the equivalent of the English ‘less ...
than’ construction. (The idiom wala sa kalingkingan — literally ‘not at the little finger’ ~ is sometimes used
to express the equivalent of English ‘much less ... than’:

Wala ka sa kalingkingan niya sa sipag.
‘You’re much less diligent than he.’
(Literally: ‘You're not at his little finger in diligence.”)

Tagalog has several constructions that correspond to English ‘more/-er ... than’ constructions. The
Tagalog equivalents of ‘more/-er’ are: mas, lalo plus the linker -ng (hereafter /along), and higit plus the
linker na/-ng (hereafter higit na). The Tagalog equivalents of ‘than’ are kaysa sa, Kaysa, and sa.

The three ways of expressing ‘more/-er’ differ from one another in frequency and/or meaning. Aas is
the most frequent. Lalong (or its variant mas lalong) may replace mas when the speaker wishes to call
special attention to one of certain types of contrast. The contrast may be with something said by another
speaker: ¢.g.,

A: Mas maganda si Rosa kaysa sa kapatid niya, ano?
‘Rosa is prettier than her sister, isn’t she’

B: Hindi! (mas) lalong maganda ang kapatid niya kaysa sa kaniya.
‘No! Her sister is prettier than she is.’

Or the contrast may be with a stated or implied expectation (in which case it is sometimes equivalent to
English ‘even more’): e.g.,

Nagbakasyon ako sa Baguio, pero Jalong mainit doon kaysa dito.
‘L vacationed in Baguio, but it was even hotter there than here.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
 

240 CHAPTER 4

(Lalong or its post-verb equivalent, na/-ng plus lalo, also occurs as an adverb meaning ‘all the
more/-er’: e.g.,

\ lalo siyang tumataba.
Hindi siya kumakain, pero

tumataba siyang lalo.
‘She doesn’t cat, but she gets all the fatter.”)

Higit na is the literary equivalent of mas, and is rather rare in ordinary conversation.
The three equivalents of English ‘than’ —kaysa sa, Kaysa, and sa — are interchangeable in a good
many contexts. For example:

kaysa sa kaibigan niya.
Mas matanda siya kaysa kaibigan niya.
sa kaibigan niya.
‘He is older than his friend.”

(In certain contexts, to be discussed below, only kaysa sa and kaysa, or kaysa alone, may occur.) If the
OBJECT OF COMPARISON —i.c., the word that follows Kaysa sa, Kaysa, or sa — is expressed by a
pronoun, this pronoun is always a sa form (cf. §3.3). Thus:

kaysa sa akin.
Mas matanda siya kaysa akin.

sa akin.
‘He is older than [ am.’

If the object of comparison is expressed by a personal noun, kaysa sa and kaysa are followed by kay, while
sa is replaced by kay:

{ kaysa sa kay Juan.
kaysa kay Juan.
kay Juan.

Mas matanda siya

‘He is older than Juan.’

Similarly, if the object of comparison is expressed by a deictic pronoun, kaysa sa and kaysa are followed by
the sa form of the deictic (cf. §3.4), while sa is replaced by the /d/ of the sa form of the deictic:

kaysa sa doon.
Mas matanda siya kaysa doon.
doon.
‘He is older than that one.’

Provided one of the equivalents of ‘than’ is present, no equivalent of ‘more’ need be expressed in
most cases. That is, mas, falong, and higit na are usually optional in the ‘more... than’
comparison-of-inequality construction. Thus:

Mabigat ang aso kaysa sa pusa.
“The dog is heavier than the cat.’

as well as:
Mas

Lalong mabigat ang aso kaysa sa pusa.
Higit na

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 241

(If the object of comparison is implied, rather than expressed by a kaysa sa phrase, etc., some equivalent of
more is necessary to express the comparison of inequality:

Siya ang mas matanda, ano?
‘He’s the older one, isn’t he?’

Siya ang matanda, ano? would mean ‘He’s the old one, isn’t he?’ Some other cases in which some equivalent
of ‘more’ is obligatory are mentioned below.)

The examples of mas ... kaysa sa, etc. constructions presented thus far have involved as the
SUBJECT OF COMPARISON the topic of an equational sentence whose predicate is an adjective. (The
subject of comparison is the clement to which the object of comparison is compared.) The topic of an
equational sentece may also be the subject of comparison if the predicate is a pseudo-verb-phrase (cf.
$4.21), or if it includes an adjective used as a modifier or followed by the basic form of a verb (ct.
§4.17): eg.,

{ kaysa (sa) besbol.
(Mas) gusto niya ang basketbol

sa besbol.
‘He likes basketball better than baseball.’

kaysa (sa) akin.
(Mas) mahusay na istudyante si Juan

sa akin.

‘Juan is a better student than I am.

j kaysa (sa) iyo.
(Mas) malakas kumain si Pedro
l sa iyo.
“Pedro eats more heartily than you do.’

The topic of a narrational sentence may be the subject of comparison when either of the following
conditions is met: (1) the verb in the sentence has a pseudo-verb base, or is one of a small list of verbs

expressing attitudes; (2) the sentence includes a manner adverb consisting of nang plus a ma- adjective, or of
ama- adjective plus the linker na/-ng (cf. §6.10). Some examples are:

(1) Mas aayawan mo ang siyudad kaysa sa probinsya.
‘You will dislike the city more than the provinces.’

Mas pinaniniwalaan ko si Juan kaysa sa kay Pedro.
‘I believe Juan more than Pedro.’

(2) Nagsayaw si Petra nang mas mahusay }
kaysa sa iyo.
Mas mahusay na nagsayaw si Petra j
‘Petra danced better than you.”

Makakagawa ang bata noon nang mas madali )

kaysa sa akin.
Mas madaling makakagawa ang bata noon {
‘The child will be able to do that more easily than I.’

In constructions like those under (1) above, some equivalent of ‘more’ is normally required. Thus
there is no:

* Aayawan mo ang siyudad kaysa sa probinsya.
*Pinaniniwalaan ko si Juan kaysa sa kay Pedro.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
242 CHAPTER 4

In constructions involving an adverb of manner consisting of nang plus a ma- adjective, mas is optional for
some speakers, obligatory for others. Thus, also, for some speakers:

Nagsayaw si Petra nang mahusay kaysa sa iyo.

If there is no equivalent of ‘more’ in such a construction, however, the sa equivalent of than may not occur.
Thus there is no:

*Nagsayaw si Petra nang mahusay sa iyo.

When the adverb of manner consists of a yma- adjective plus the linker na/-ng, some equivalent of ‘more’ is
always required.

The subject of comparison need not be the topic. In sentence types similar to those in which the
topic may occur as the subject of comparison (sentences that include adjectives, pseudo-verb-base verbs,
manner adverbs, etc.), a number of other sentence elements may also occur as the subject of
comparison: e.g., 2g phrases, s¢ phrases, verb phrases, and adverbs. In general, the comparison-of-inequality
constructions are the same when one of these elements is the subject of comparison as in the cases already
discussed. There are, however, certain differences in detail.

Certain speakers, for example, allow an optional ng after kaysa (but not after (kaysa)sa) when ang
phrase is the subject of comparison: ¢.g.,

(Mas) mahal ang baro ni Nene kaysa ng nanay.
‘Nene’s dress is more expensive than Mother's.’

as well as:
kaysa(sa)

(Mas) mahal ang baro ni Nene nanay.
sa

When a sa phrase is the subject of comparison, the sa equivalent of than’ does not occur. Thus:

Mas madalas kaming pumupunta sa kabundukan kaysa (sa) baybayin.
‘We go to the mountains more often than the seashore.’

but not, as an equivalent sentence:
*Mas madalas kaming pumupunta sa kabundukan sa baybayin.

The sa equivalent of ‘than’ also fails to occur when the subject of comparison is a verb phrase or an
adverb. Thus:

Mas madalas siyang nagpasyal kaysa (sa) pumasok.
‘He paid calls more often than he went to work.’

(Mas) mainit ngayon kaysa (sa) kahapon.
‘It’s hotter today than it was yesterday.”

but not:

*Mas madalas siyang nagpasyal sa pumasok.
*Mas mainit ngayon sa kahapon.

In addition to the already-presented constructions for expressing a comparison of inequality, there is
a special moderative-comparative construction that is equivalent to English ‘a little more... than’. This
construction, which involves a duplicated moderative adjective (cf. §4.13), is similar to the constructions
with Kaysa sa, Kaysa, and sa discussed above. It differs from these constructions only in that, for most
speakers at least, the omission of any overt equivalent of ‘more’ is greatly preferred in this case. Thus:

kaysa sa kay Maria.
Maganda-ganda si Rosa kaysa kay Maria.
kay Maria.
‘Rosa is a little prettier than Maria.’

but also, for some speakers:

Some further examples of the modcrative-comparative construction are:

Mas maganda-ganda si Rosa kaysa sa kay Maria, etc.

Tumakbo si Ed nang mabilis-bilis kaysa kay Bob.
‘Ed ran a little faster than Bob.’

Mabigat-bigat ang maleta mo kaysa sa akin.
“Your suitcase is a little heavier than mine.’

Marami-raming tao doon kaysa dito.
‘There are a few more people there than here.”

Mahusay-husay siyang kumanta kaysa sumayaw.
‘She sings somewhat better than she dances.’

Malamig-lamig kahapon kaysa sa ngayon.
‘It was a little cooler yesterday than it is today.”

§4.16. Superlative constructions.
The superlative degree of an adjective (usually equivalent to English ‘most’ plus adjective, or adjective
plus ‘-est’) is generally expressed in Tagalog by the prefix pinaka- /pinaka/ plus an adjective. Pinaka- occurs

before both ma- adjectives (with retention of ma-) and unaffixed adjectives:

Adjective Superlative
mabuti ‘good’ > pinakamabuti
malamig ‘cold’ > pinakamalamig
masarap ‘delicious’ > pinakamasarap
interesante ‘interesting? > pinakainteresante
mura ‘cheap’ > pinakamura
sariwa ‘fresh’ > pinakasariwa

‘best’

‘coldest’

‘most delicious’
‘most interesting’
‘cheapest’
‘freshest’

The pinaka- formation may occur in any of the contexts in which the underlying adjective itself occurs: as

a predicate, in a nominalized position, before the basic form of a verb, as an adverb of manner, or in a
modification construction. For example:

Pinakasariwa ang kanilang isda.
‘Their fish is freshest.”

Si Mang Pepe ang pinakamatanda.
‘The oldest is Mang Pepe.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
244 CHAPTER 4

Siya ang pinakamabilis tumakbo.
‘He is the one who runs fastest.”

Si Nene ang namimili nang pinakamadalas.
‘The one who goes shopping most often is Nene."

Siya ang pinakamagandang babae dito.
‘She is the most beautiful woman here.’

Ang anak na pinakabata ang bunso.
‘The bunso is the youngest child.”

A pinaka- formation may also be followed by a sa-phrase complement which translates an English ‘of
or ‘among’ phrase after a superlative:

Pinili ni Rosa ang pinakamagara sa mga terno.
‘Rosa chose the most attractive of the ternos.”

Si Maria ang dalagang pinakamayaman kina Luisa.
“Maria is the richest girl of Luisa’s circle.”

Siya ang pinakamatalinong tao sa kanila.
‘He is the most intelligent person among them.’

Note that when the pinaka- formation is used as a modifier before a noun, the sa-phrase complement
generally follows the noun rather than the adjective: thus, ang pinakamatalinong tao sa kanila ‘the most
intelligent person among them’.

The sa-phrase complement is usually explicitly pluralized. For some speakers, however, explicit
pluralization is optional in the case of unmarked nouns. Such speakers might say, for example,
pinakamagara sa terno as well as pinakamagara sa mga terno ‘most attractive of the fernos'’.

A ma- adjective after pinaka- may be pluralized in the usual way, by duplication (cf. §4.11):

Sila ang pinakamaiingay na bata.
‘They are the noisiest children.”

In addition to the pinaka- formation, Tagalog has another superlative formation, which involves the
prefix ka- /ka:/ followed by a disyllabic duplicating prefix, and the suffix -an. In the case of ma- adjectives,
ma: itself is deleted: maliit ‘small’ > Kaliit-liitan ‘smallest’.

The ka- ... -an superlative formation occurs with a limited list of adjectives, most of them unaffixed
adjectives, a few of them ma- adjectives. Among the unaffixed adjectives that occur with Ka- ... -an are
una ‘first’ and hudi ‘lateflast’, the ka- ... -an formations having the meanings ‘first of all’ and ‘last of all”
respectively.

As noted above, the vowel of the prefix ka- is long. In addition, the vowel of the syllable before -an is
always long. If the underlying adjective is disyllabic and ends in a consonant other than /h/ or /’/, there are
no other long vowels in the ka- ... -an formation. If the underlying adjective is disyllabic and ends in fh/
or /*/, or if the underlying adjective has more than two syllables, there is one additional long vowel: the
second vowel of the duplicating prefix. A long vowel in the second duplicating syllable is always
syllable-final. (That is, there is no duplication of the final /h/ or /’/ of an underlying disyllabic adjective, or
of any final consonant in the second syllable of a longer underlying adjective.) These rules for the
formation of ka- ... -an superlatives are illustrated below:

banal /banal/ > kabanal-banalan /ka‘banalbana‘lan/
‘virtuous’ ‘most virtuous”

malinis /mali‘nisf > kalinis-linisan /ka‘linislini*san/
‘clean’ ‘cleanest’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 245

mura /mu‘rah/ > kamura-murahan /ka*mura‘mura‘han/
‘cheap’ “cheapest”
luma /lu-ma’} > kaluma-lumaan /ka‘luma‘luma*’an/
‘old’ ‘oldest’
baluktot /baluktot!/ > kabalu-baluktutan /ka‘balu‘baluktu‘tan/
‘bent’ ‘most bent’
gulanit /gulanit} > kagula-gulanitan /ka‘gula-gulani:tan/
‘ragged’ ‘most ragged”
Except in the case of Kauna-unahan ‘first of all’ and Kahuli-hulihan ‘last of all’, the Ka- .. -an

superlatives generally connote some kind of negative attitude in the speaker: e.g., disapproval of the action
being spoken of. Thus, the sentence:

Ang kaluma-lumaang libro niya ang ibinigay niya sa akin.
‘What he gave me was his oldest book.’

clearly expresses disapproval of the action, and differs in this respect from the more neutral:

Ang pinakalumang libro niya ang ibinigay niya sa akin.
‘What he gave me was his oldest book.”

In English, this kind of negative attitude is sometimes expressible only by intonation and voice quality, in
other cases is expressed by ‘even’:

Ikinagagalit nila ang kaliit-liitang bagay.
“Even the littlest thing makes them angry.”

Like the pinaka- superlative, the Ka-.. -am superlative sometimes occurs with a sa-phrase
complement:

Pinang-vupisina ni Helen ang kamahal-mahalan sa mga damit niya.
‘Helen wears the most expensive of hes clothes to the office.’

$4.17. Adjective-plus-complement constructions.

Various constructions that consist of an adjective followed by another word or phrase may
conveniently be grouped together as ADJECTIVE-PLUS-COMPLEMENT CONSTRUCTIONS. The first
element of all such constructions is an adjective; the second may be called an ADJECTIVE COMPLEMENT.
Certain types of adjective complements are discussed elsewhere in this text, in connection with the
particular classes of adjectives after which they occur: e.g., the object and/or directional complements that
may follow instrumental pang- adjectives (cf. $4.8), and the actor complements within pseudo-verb phrases
(cf. §4.21). Most other types of adjective complements are discussed in the present section. The
complement types discussed are: (1) para sa_ phrases; (2) sa phrases; (3) ng phrases;
(4) linker-plus-basic-form constructions; (5) Asng-plus-basic-form constructions. These are presented
below and on the following pages in the listed order.

(1) Constructions consisting of an adjective followed by a para sa phrase (para sa plus an unmarked
noun or plus the sa form of a personal pronoun, para kay or para kina plus a personal noun, para plus the sa

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
246 CHAPTER 4

form of a deictic pronoun) are usually equivalent to English constructions consisting of an adjective
followed by a ‘for’ phrase: ¢.g.,

bagay ‘suitable

kailangan ‘necessary

kasya ‘adequate (in size)

dapat sa bata ‘appropriate the child”

mabuti sa iyo “good you’
para for

madali kay Maria ‘easy Maria’

mahirap doon ‘hard that (one)’

mainam ‘pleasant

masama ‘bad

tama ‘right

The para in the para sa phrase may normally be deleted without affecting the meaning of the construction.
Thus: bagay (para) sa bata ‘suitable for the child’, kailangan (para}sa iyo ‘necessary for you’, etc.

When a construction consisting of an adjective plus a para-sa- phrase complement occurs in predicate
position, the complement may optionally be moved to a position after the topic. Thus:

(para) sa bata ang baro.
Bagay

ang baro (para) sa bata.
‘The dress is suitable for the child.’

Similarly, when the complement construction is used as a preposed modifier in a modification construction
(cf. §3.11, ff.), the complement may optionally be moved to a position after the head:

bagay (para) sa batang damit.
Naghahanap ako ng

bagay na damit (para) sa bata.
‘I am looking for a dress (that is) suitable for the child.’

(When the complement is separated from the adjective in this way, retention of para is preferred if the
adjective is a ma- adjective. Thus, usually, Afadali ang trabaho para sa bata ‘The work is easy for the child’,
rather than Madali ang trabaho sa bata, and Naghahanap ako ng madaling trabaho para sa bata ‘1 am looking
for some work that is easy for the child’, rather than Naghahanap ako ng madaling trabaho sa bata.)

Some further examples of the uses of adjective-plus-para-sa-phrase constructions are:

Siguro hindi mabuti (para) kay Maria ang mabuti (para) sa iyo.
‘Perhaps what is good for you is not good for Maria."

Walang kasya (para) doon sa buong tindahan.
‘There's nothing that fits that one in the whole store.”
(Literally: ‘There's nothing adequate (in size) for that one... ")

Huwag mo silang bigyan ng mga librong masyadong mahirap (para) sa kanila.
‘Don’t give them books that are too hard for them.’

(2) Constructions consisting of an adjective followed by asa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun or
plus the sa form of a personal pronoun, Xay or kina plus a personal noun, or the sa form of a deictic
pronoun) are usually equivalent to English constructions consisting of an adjective followed by a

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 247

prepositional phrase. Various English prepositions may be equivalent to the sa of the Tagalog
constructions: e.g., ‘at’, as in:

mahusay ‘good )
sa trabaho > at (the) work’
masipag ‘diligent \
‘of,’ as in:
mahilig ) ‘fond
doon of that’
takot j ‘afraid
‘to,’ as in:
hirati ) ‘used )
é kay Maria to Maria.”
malupit j ‘cruel f
‘with,’ as in:
galit ‘angry
sa kanila with them’
yamot ‘bored

A sa-phrase complement that is part of an adjectival predicate may, like a para-sa-phrase complement
(see above), optionally be moved to a position after the topic. Thus:

sa kanila si Juan.
Galit

si Juan sa kanila.
‘Juan is angry with them.”

Unlike a para-sa-phrase complement, however, a sa-phrase complement forming part of a preposed modifier
may not ordinarily be moved to a position after the head. Thus ang galit sa Kanilang tao ‘the person who is
angry with them’, but not “ang galit na tao sa kanila.

Some further examples of the uses of adjective-plus-sa- phrase constructions are:

Sino iyong napakahusay sa trabaho?
‘Who is that one who's very good at the work?”

Ayaw ko sa mga taong malupit sa hayop.
‘I don’t like people who are cruel to animals.’

Bakit ka galit sa akin?
‘Why are you angry with me?’

(3) Ng phrases (ng plus an unmarked noun, etc.) occur as complements after a small number of
adjectives. The adjectives after which ng-phrase complements occur are often translatable by verbs in
English —¢.g., Kapos ‘lack(s)’, kulang ‘lack(s)’, maninong ‘know(s)’, matakaw  ‘cat(s)
voraciously’ — and the complement phrases by verbal objects: e.g.,

kapos ng pera ‘lack(s) money’

kulang ng asin ‘lack(s) salt’

marunong ng Tagalog ‘know(s) Tagalog’
matakaw ng kanin ‘eat(s) rice voraciously.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
At least three adjectives — bukod ‘separate’, hiwalay ‘separate’, and sabay ‘together’ — take ds
complements ng phrases of the shape ng plus gerund or verb base (cf. § §3.26 and 3.27), the gerund or verb
base expressing an activity performed ‘separately’ or ‘together’: e.g.,

bukod ) pagkain

ng ‘eat(s) separately”
hiwalay f kain

pag-alis
sabay ng ‘leave(s) together”

alis

Bukod and hiwalay (but not sabay) also take complements of the shape ng plus unmarked noun:

bukod )

ng mesa ‘at a separate table’
hiwalay {

Like sa-phrase complements, ng-phrase complements occurring as part of an adjectival predicate may
optionally be moved to a position after the topic. Thus:

{ ng pera si Juan.
Kapos

si Juan ng pera.
‘Juan lacks moncy.”

\ ng Tagalog ang Amerikano.
Marunong

ang Amerikano ng Tagalog.
‘The American knows Tagalog.’

{ ng pagkain ang bagong-kasal.
Bukod

ang bagong-kasal ng pagkain.
‘The newly-weds eat separately.”

(Kapos and kulang accept sa-phrase complements in place of ng-phrase complements; thus, also: kapos sa
pera, kulang sa asin.)

(4) The basic form of a verb (cf. §2.8) consists of the basic form of an affix plus a verb base. Thus
magtayo (to) build’, which consists of the basic affix mag- and the verb base rayo, is the basic form that
corresponds to the aspect-marked verb forms :agtatayo ‘will build’, nagtatayo ‘build(s)’, and nagtayo
‘built’. Basic forms of verbs occur in adjective-plus-complement constructions of two types: a type in
which the basic form is preceded by a linker (discussed immediately below), and a type in which the basic
form is preceded by the particle kung (discussed in subsection (5)).

Constructions consisting of an adjective followed by a linker plus a basic form may be divided into
two subclasses on the basis of the type(s) of linker that occur in the constructions. In one subclass, cither
the linker -ng (cf. §3.8) or the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) may occur; in the other, only the linker -ng may
occur. (The linker -ng and the linker na/-ng have identical forms when the preceding word ends, in its
independent form, in /’/, /n/, or /h/. In these contexts, both linkers are manifested as an /u/ replacing the
word-final consonant. In all other contexts, the linker -ng is manifested as a zero form, while the linker
na/-ng is manifested as the word na /na/.)

The two subclasses differ not only in form, but also in the meaning relationship that holds between
the adjective and the basic form, and in the meaning relationship that holds between the construction as a
whole and its referent. Sentences in which the two constructions occur in predicate position may

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 249

conveniently be used by way of example. In such sentences, if the adjective-plus-complement construction
belongs to the first subclass (i.c., the subclass in which the basic form may be preceded by either-ng or na/-ng),
the adjective generally designates a characteristic of the topic, and the basic form designates the activity in
which this characteristic is manifested. Thus in the sentence:

Sanay (na) kumanta si Petra.
‘Petra is experienced at singing.”

The adjective sanay ‘experienced’ designates a characteristic of si Petra ‘Petra’, and the basic form kwmanta
‘sing(ing)’ designates the activity in which this characteristic is manifested. If, on the other hand, the
adjective-plus-complement construction belongs to the second subclass (i.¢., the subclass in which the basic
form is preceded only by the linker -ng), the adjective generally expresses the way in which the activity
designated by the basic form is characteristically performed by the topic. (The construction is often
translatable by a verb-plus-adverb construction in English.) Thus in the sentence:

Malakas kumanta si Petra.
‘Petra sings loudly.”

the adjective malakas ‘loud(ly)’ expresses the way in which the activity expressed by Aumanta is
characteristically performed by si Petra. (In some cases, the adjective expresses the time at which an activity
is characteristically performed, rather than the way in which it is performed: e.g., Maagang gumising si
Petra ‘Petra gets up early’. )

The basic form in constructions belonging to the first subclass is normally actor-focus (cf. §2.9). It
may be followed by any object and/or directional complements taken by the inflected forms of the verb.
Thus:

Sanay (na) kumanta ng mga imno si Petra.
‘Petra is experienced at singing hymns.’

Tamad (na) pumunta sa opisina si Ben.
‘Ben is lazy about going to the office.”

The basic form in constructions belonging to the second subclass may be either actor-focus or
goal-focus. Actor-focus basic forms may be followed by object and/or directional complements; goal-focus
basic forms by actor complements. Thus:

( kumanta ng mga imno si Petra.

Malakas
( kantahin ni Petra ang mga imno.
hymns )
‘Petra sings loudly.”
the hymns {
\ pumunta sa opisina si Ben.
Mabilis

puntahan ni Ben ang opisina.
‘Ben goes to the office quickly.”

Some further examples of sentences involving constructions belonging to the first subclass are:

Bantulot (na) umalis ang mga tao.
‘The people are reluctant to leave.”

250 CHAPTER 4

Interesado daw (na) magtayo ng bahay ang doktor.
‘They say that the doctor is interested in building a house.”

Marunong (na) magsalita ng Inggles si Juan.
‘Juan knows how to speak English.’

(Literally: ‘Juan is knowledgeable (about) speaking English.)

Some further examples of sentences involving constructions belonging to the second subclass are:

" Mahal sumingil ang tinderong iyon.
‘That storekeeper charges a lot.”
(More literally: ‘That storekeeper charges expensively.’)

Madali daw basagin ang porselana.
‘They say that porcelain breaks easily.”

Matagal silang magtrabaho.
‘They work slowly.”

(5) Constructions consisting of an adjective followed by the particle Aung plus the basic form of a
verb are similar in meaning to the second subclass of basic-form-complement constructions discussed under
(4) above: the adjective in the construction expresses the way in which the action designated by the basic |
form is characteristically performed. Thus in the sentence:

Pasigaw kung kumanta si Petra.
‘Petra shouts when she sings.’ |

by Aumanta ‘sing(ing)’ is performed.

Any pa- manner adjective (cf. §4.7) may be followed by a complement consisting of kung plus a
basic form (of an actor-focus verb), plus, optionally, the complements of the verb. In the English
equivalents, the pa- adjective is in some cases translatable by a verb, the complement by a ‘when’

The adjective pasigaw (literally ‘in a shouting manner’) characterizes the way in which the action expressed
construction: ¢.g.,

Patayo kung mamalantsa ang Nanay.
‘Mother stands when she irons.’

Or the pa-adjective mav be translated by some kind of adverbial construction, the complement by the
main verb of the sentence: e.g.,

Pasayaw kung lumakad ang batang babae.
‘The girl walks as if dancing.”

 

i Paismid kung makinig ang mga mag-aaral.
| ‘The students listen with a grimace.”

Kung-plus-basic-form complements also occur after certain time expressions (cf. §6.8): ¢.g.,

 

Gabi

Maaga kung gumising si Petra.
| Tanghali j
i { late.’

‘Petra gets up early.”

at noon.”
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 251

And some speakers use Kung-plus-basic-form complements after ma- adjectives expressing the way in which
the action expressed by the verb is characteristically performed. For these speakers, the construction with
kung alternates freely in these cases with the second-type of linker-plus-complement construction presented
under (4) above: e.g.,

Mabilis tumakbo )

si Juan.
Mabilis kung tumakbo j
‘Juan runs fast.’

Other speakers, however, do not allow the Aung construction in these cases.

§4.18. Phrases expressing similarity.

The equivalent of an English ‘like’ phrase is often expressed in Tagalog by a construction consisting of
gaya {ga‘yah/ or kagaya /kaga‘yah/ plus a mg phrase. (Gaya and kagaya alternate freely.) Some examples
are:

Gaya

ng sapatos mo ang sapatos ko.
Kagaya
‘My shoes are like your shoes.”
Gaya

ni Juan ang kapatid niya.
Kagaya

‘His brother is like Juan.’
(Or: ‘Juan’s brother is like him.”)

Gaya }

ninyo sila.
Kagaya \
‘They are like you.”
Gaya

niyan ito.
Kagaya
‘This is like that.’

When, as in the last example, the ng phrase following gaya (but not kagaya) is the ng form of a deictic
pronoun, the vowel length plus /ya/ are optionally deletable. The contractions that result from this optional
deletion are written as single words. Thus:

Full form Contracted form

gaya nire ganire ‘like this’
~

/garya nireh/ {ganirehj

gaya nito ganito ‘like this’
>

Iga'ya nitoh/ /ganitoh/

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
252 CHAPTER 4

Full form Contracted form

gaya niyan ganyan ‘like that?

{gaya nyan/ ” /ganyan/

gaya noon ganoon ‘like that’
>

{gaya nu’on/ /ganu’on/{

(As was noted in §3.4, the deictic pronoun jyon has two freely alternating ng forms, niyon and noon.
While both of these forms occur after (ka}gaya, only noon commonly occurs in a contraction after ga-.
There is an irregular contracted formation corresponding to gaya niyon — namcly, gayon — but it is rarcly
used in standard Manila Tagalog.) Some examples of the use of the contracted formations in sentences are:

Ganyan ito.
‘This is like that.”

Ganoon ang buhay.
‘Life is like that.’

The contracted formations ganire, etc., may be followed by an adjective formation that specifies the
quality with respect to which the two objects, etc., being compared are similar. (Neither the uncontracted
formations nor the contracted formations with initial ka occur in this construction.) The adjective
formation following the contraction consists either of ka- plus an unaffixed adjective (cf. §4.2) or of ka-
plus the base of a ma- adjective (cf. §4.3). Some speakers use the linker -ng before the ka- formation; others
do not. Thus:

{ ‘new like this (one)”
ganito(ng) kabago (cf. bago ‘new’)
| ‘as new as this (one)’
‘big like this (one)
ganito(ng) kalaki (cf. malaki ‘big*)
‘as big as this (one)’

Some examples in sentences are:

Ganito(ng) kaberde ang baro niya,
‘Her dress is green like this (onc).”

Ganyan(g) katanda ang lola ko.
old like
‘My grandmother is that.”
l as old as

Ganoon(g) kalaki ang kotse niya.
big like )
‘His car is that.’

as big as{

(In one of its meanings, the construction under discussion is more or less synonymous with certain
comparison-of-equality constructions presented in §4.14: ¢.g.,

Kasinglaki noon ang kotse niya.
‘His car is as big as that.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 253

The comparison-of-equality construction, however, is always used to assert that two objects, etc. are the
same with respect to a given quality without suggesting to what extent the two actually manifest the
quality. Thus the above sentence mercly asserts that ‘his car’ and ‘that’ are similar in size, without asserting
whether the two are actually big or small. The construction under discussion, on the other hand, may mean
either that two objects, etc., are the same with respect to a given quality, or that both actually manifest the
quality. Thus Ganoon(g) kalaki ang kotse niya may mean either that ‘his car’ and ‘that’ are similar in size,
or that both are in fact ‘big’. To take another example, either Kasingtanda niyan ang lola ko ‘My
grandmother is as old as that’ or Ganyan(g) katanda ang lola ko may be used in speaking of two people of
the same age, regardless of whether both are in fact ‘old’. The second sentence, however, may also be used
to speak of two people who are not of the same age — one might be eighty, the other ninety — but both of
whom are ‘old’.)

A phrase consisting of ganito(ng), etc. plus a ka- formation may occur in most of the same contexts as
does the adjective or adjective base that underlies the ka- formation. If, for example, this adjective occurs
with a basic form complement (cf. §4.17) or in a manner adverb (cf. §6.10), the phrase introduced by
ganito(ng) ka-, etc. may also so occur: ¢.g.,

Ganito(ng) kabilis tumakbo si Juan.
fast like this.’
‘Juan runs

| as fast as this.’

Ganoong kabuti siyang nagsalita ng Tagalog.
{ well like this.’

‘He spoke Tagalog

l as well as this.’

Duplicated plurals of ma- adjective bases (cf. §4.11) may occur in phrases introduced by ganito(ng)
ka-, etc. Duplicated plurals of certain unaffixed adjectives also occur in this construction. Examples are:

Ganito (ng) kalalaki ang mga bahay nila.
big like this.’
‘Their houses are
as big as this.’

Ganyan(g) kamumura ang mga bulaklak na binili ni Jose.
f cheap like that.’

‘The flowers Jose bought are

as cheap as that.’

(Not all unaffixed adjectives may occur as bases in a ka- formation. In general, those unaffixed
adjectives that are related to nouns with loss of inherent length (e.g., hilo ‘dizzy’, pagod ‘tired’ — cf. §4.2)
fail to occur after ka-.)

In addition to (ka)gaya phrases and their derivatives, Tagalog has several other types of phrases that
express similarity. General similarity of the kind expressed by (kagaya constructions may be expressed by

a construction consisting of para /pa‘tah/ plus the linker -ug plus a nominal. The nominal may be an
unmarked noun, sifna) plus a personal noun, or the aig form of a personal or deictic pronoun. Some
examples are:

Parang Maynila ang siyudad na ito.
‘This city is like Manila.’

Parang si Juan ang kapatid niya.
‘His brother is like Juan.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
CHAPTER 4
Parang kayo ako.
‘T'm like you.”

Parang iyon ito.
‘This is like that.’

(In formal or literary language, general similarity is also expressed by tulad /tu'lad/ plus asa or ng phrase or
by Katulad {katu‘tad/ plus ang phrase: ¢.g.,

{sa

Tulad ulan ang luha niya.
(nf
“Her tears are like rain.’

Katulad nito iyon.
‘That is like this.’)

Similarity of function, equivalent to an English construction with ‘count(s) as’ or ‘serve(s) as’ may be
expressed by a construction consisting of bilang /bi‘lan/ plus a nominal. For example:

Bilang pera sa kanila ang mga suso.
‘Shells count as money among them.’

Bilang tagapamahala na siya ng tindahan.
‘He serves as manager of the store now.”

Physical resemblance is expressed either by mukha /mukha’/ ‘looking like’ plus the linker -ng plus an
unmarked noun or by the derived noun kamukha {kamukha’} ‘one looking like’ (cf. §3.7, subsection (5))

plus a ng phrase. The muskha construction expresses resemblance to an unspecified member of a class of
objects, etc., the kKamukha construction expresses resemblance to a specific object, etc. Thus:

Mukhang pabrika ang bahay.
‘The house looks like a factory.”

Kamukha ng pabrika ang bahay.
‘The house looks like the factory.’

§4.19. Locative adjective phrases.

Tagalog has LOCATIVE PHRASES (phrases expressing location) of two classes: LOCATIVE
ADJECTIVE PHRASES and LOCATIVE ADVERBIAL PHRASES. Locative adjective phrases are discussed
in the present section; locative adverbial phrases are discussed in §6.9.

Locative adjective phrases normally consist of na /na*/ plus a sa phrase. When the nominal in the sa
phrase is an unmarked noun or (the sa form of) a personal pronoun, na and sa are conventionally written as

a single word:

nasa kusina ‘in the kitchen’
\ “with you’

nasa iyo
(‘in your possession’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 255

When the nominal in the sa phrase is a personal noun, sa is replaced by kay (or its plural counterpart kina),
and a is conventionally written as a separate word:

‘with Nena’
na kay Nena
‘in Nena’s possession”

{ with Nena and her friends’
na kina Nena
lin the possession of Nena and her friends’

When the nominal in the sa phrase is a deictic pronoun, the sa form of a deictic is used. As was noted in
§3.4, the sa forms of the deictics are: dine, dito, diyan and doon, In locative-adjective phrases, either the
initial /d/ of the deictic is replaced by /r/ (a common phonemic alternation -- cf. §1.20) or an /n/ is
inserted between na and the initial /d/ of the deictic. The two formations alternate freely for most speakers.
Thus:

narine /na‘ri‘neh/ )

‘here’
nandine jna-ndirnch/f
narito /na‘ritoh/

‘here’
nandito /na‘ndi‘toh/
naryan /na‘ryan/

‘there*
nandyan /na‘ndyan/
naroon /na-ru’on/

‘there’

nandoon /na‘ndu’on/

In addition to the above formations, there are formations of identical meaning involving duplicating
syllables. These formations are:

naririne /na‘ri(*)ri‘neh/

‘here’
nandidine /na‘ndi(-)di-neh/
naririto /na‘ri(‘)ritoh/

‘here’
nandidito /na‘ndi(*)di‘toh/
nariryan /na‘ri(*)ryan/ )

‘there’
nandidyan /na‘ndi(-)dyan/ j
narusoon /na‘ru(‘)ru’on/ ‘there’

(Vowel length in the duplicating syllable is optional in all cases. There is no duplicated form corresponding
to nandoon in educated Manila Tagalog.)

256 CHAPTER 4

When the nominal in the locative phrase is an unmarked noun representing a place or an inanimate

oe 6

object, the phrase is usually equivalent to an English phrase introduced by ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘at’, etc.

Nasa Maynila ang gusali.
‘The building is in Manila.’

Nasa mesa ang libro.
‘The book is on the table.’

Nasa opisina si Esting.
‘Esting is at/in the office.’

(May may be inserted between nasa and the noun to indicate approximate location: e.g.,

Nasa may Baguio ang gusali.

vicinity of Baguio.’
‘The building is in the

Baguio area.” )

When the nominal is an unmarked noun representing a person, or is a personal pronoun or a personal
noun, the phrase has one of several English equivalents. If the referent of the topic is animate, the phrase
may often be translated by a ‘with’ phrase in English: ¢.g.,

Nasa babae
Nasa akin . ang sanggol.
Na kay Maria

the woman.’
‘The baby is with me.”

Maria.’

(Plural personal pronouns are often used in the meaning ‘at ___ place’: e.g.,

amin
atin
Nasa si Pedro.
inyo
kanila
our
our
‘Pedro is at place.”)
your
their

If the referent of the topic is inanimate, the phrase may often be translated by an ‘in ___’s possession’
phrase in English, or more idiomatically, by a construction with ‘has/have’:

Nasa babae ang libro.
‘The book is in the woman’s possession.”
‘The woman has the book.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 257

Nasa akin ang pera.
{re money is in my Possession}
‘T have the money.”

Na kay Maria ang manika.
{ime doll is in Maria’s possesion}
“Maria has the doll.’

(The above constructions differ in meaning from the possessive sa and may constructions discussed in
§4.22. The nasa construction denotes temporary possession of a specifically identified object, the sa
construction denotes ownership of such an object; the may construction denotes cither temporary
possession or ownership of an object that is not specifically identified. Compare the following sentences:

Nasa babae ang libro.
‘The woman has the book.’

Sa babae ang libro.
‘The woman owns the book.”

May libro ang babac.
‘The woman has a book.’)

When the nominal in a locative adjective phrase is a deictic pronoun, the phrase is equivalent to ‘here’
or ‘in/at this place’ or to ‘there’ or ‘in/at that place’. (The four categories of deictics show the same meaning
differences in locative phrases that they show elsewhere — cf. §3.4). Thus:

Narito si Juan.
here.’
‘Juan is
infat this place.’

Naroon si Juan.
{ there.’

‘Juan is

l in/at that place.’

A locative deictic is often used as the first clement (and head) of a modification construction, in
which case it is followed by asa phrase. (As was noted in §3.12, the sa form of a deictic, when it occurs as
the head of a modification construction, is followed by a sa phrase, rather than by a linker-plus-modifier
construction.) For example:

Narito sa Maynila si Juan.
‘Juan is here in Manila.’

When the locative deictic in such a construction is maroon (or one of its variants), the demonstrative
meaning of the deictic is often negligible, and the construction is more or less identical in meaning with a

locative construction lacking a deictic: e.g.,

Naroon sa Maynila si Juan.
‘Juan is (there) in Manila.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
258 CHAPTER 4

In addition to simple nominals (and nominalizations), the sa within a locative adjective phrase may be
followed by a POSITIONAL PHRASE. A positional phrase consists of one of a small group of unmarked
nouns — which may be called POSITIONAL NOUNS — and a ng phrase. Some common positional nouns
are:

dulo ‘end’

gitna ‘middle’
harap “front”
harapan ‘front’

ibaba ‘lower part”
ibabaw ‘place above”
ilalim ‘place beneath’
itaas ‘upper part’
labas ‘exterior’
likod ‘back’
likuran ‘back*

loob ‘interior’
tabi ‘side’

A locative phrase consisting of nasa plus a positional phrase is translated by a prepositional phrase in
English. The common equivalents are:

dulo ‘at the end of
gitna ‘in the middle/midst of
harap

‘before/in front of
harapan
ibaba ‘at the bottom of
ibabaw ‘on (top of/above’

nasa + ilalim + ng phrase “‘beneath/below’ + noun phrase

itaas ‘at the top of
labas ‘outside’
likod

‘behind/in back of
likuran
loob ‘inside’
tabi ‘beside/near/next to’

Some examples of the use of such constructions in sentences are:

Nasa gitna ng silid ang mesa.
‘The table is in the middle of the room.”

harap

Nasa nila ang titser.
harapan

‘The teacher is in front of them.’
likod )

Nasa ni Fe si Norma.
likuran j

‘Norma is behind Fe.’

Nasa tabi noon ang bukal.
‘The fountain is next to that.”

ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 259

(May, which, as noted above, is used to indicate approximate location, may precede a positional
phrase: e.g.,

Nasa may gitna ng silid ang mesa.
‘The table is approximately in the middle of the room.")

§4.20. Other relational phrases.

The present section deals with adjectival phrases of six types: (1) RESERVATIONAL PHRASES;
(2) PARTISANSHIP PHRASES; (3) PURPOSE PHRASES; (4) SOURCE PHRASES; (5) REFERENTIAL
PHRASES; and (6) RELATIVE-LOCATION PHRASES. These six phrase types are similar in that each
consists of an introductory word followed by asa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun, nominaliztion, or
sa-form personal pronoun; Kay or kina plus a personal noun; or a sa-form deictic pronoun). They are also
similar in that, when they occur in predicate position, they all express relationships between two
nominals: the nominal within the sa phrase and the topic nominal. The English equivalents of sentences
with such phrases in predicate position normally involve some form of ‘be’ plus a prepositional phrase.

(1) Reservational, partisanship, and purpose phrases are all introduced by pera /pa:rah/ ‘for’. The
three phrase types differ, however, both in meaning and, to a certain extent, in internal structure.
Reservational phrases are equivalent to ‘for’ phrases in which ‘for’ connotes ‘reserved or intended for’. The
introductory para is optionally deletable. Some examples are:

(Para) sa titser ang pontimpen.
‘The fountain pen is for the teacher.”

(Para) sa salas ang kasangkapan.
‘The furniture is for the living room.”

(Para) kay Maria ang silid na ito.
‘This room is for Maria.”

(When para is deleted, the resultant sentence is often ambiguous, since the sa phrase may be interpreted as a
possessive sa phrase — cf. §4.22. Thus Sa titser ang pontimpen may also mean ‘The fountain pen is the
teacher's’.)

(2) Partisanship phrases are equivalent to ‘for’ phrases in which ‘for’ connotes ‘in favor of (a political
party or candidate)’. Like the para of a reservational phrase, the para of a partisanship phrase is optionally
deletable. It is, however, preferably retained. Some examples are:

Para sa mga Nasyonalista ang kapatid niya.
‘His brother is for the Nationalists.”

Para kay Makapagal si Ernesto.
‘Ernesto is for Makapagal.”

(3) Purpose phrases are equivalent to ‘for’ phrases in which ‘for’ connotes ‘used for (the purpose of).’
The para that introduces the phrase is not deletable. The nominal within the sa-phrase is an aspectless
gerund (cf. §3.26). Some examples are:

Para sa pagluluto ng kanin ang palayok na ito.
‘This pot is (used) for cooking rice.”

Para sa pagsasayaw ang sapatos.
‘The shoes are (used) for dancing.’

260 CHAPTER 4

(4) Source phrases are equivalent to English ‘from’ phrases. The sa phrase within the source phrase
may be preceded by buhat /buhat/, galing /galinf mula /mula’/, or mbo /tu'bo'/. A source phrase
introduced by buhat, galing or mula is equivalent to a ‘from’ phrase that connotes ‘has/have arrived from’
or ‘has/have been sent from’:

Buhat
Galing sa Maynila ang tren.
Mula j
is )
‘The train from Manila.”
has arrived j
Buhat )
Galing sa Amerika ang pakete.
Mula {
is )
‘The package from America.’

has been sent j

(Buhat and mula — but not galing — are also used in introducing adverbials: cf. §6.8, subsection (1.e), and

§6.11, subsection (1.d). Tudo is equivalent to ‘from’ in the sense ‘hail(s) from, is a native of, are natives
of: eg.,

Tubo sa Tarlac si Miguel.
‘Miguel is from Tarlac.’

(5) Referential phrases are equivalent to English ‘about’ phrases, where ‘about’ connotes ‘on the
subject of. The sa phrase is preceded by tungkol /tunkol/, hinggil fhingilf or nauukol {na‘‘u’urkol/.
(Tungkol is the most common of the three in ordinary conversation.) Some examples are:

Tungkol kay Rizal ang kuwento.
‘The story is about Rizal.”

Hinggil sa negosyo ang usapan nila.
‘Their conversation is about business.”

Nauukol sa kanila ang balita ko.
‘My news is about them.”

(6) Relative-location phrases are introduced by paharap ‘having the face/front toward’ or patalikod
‘having the back toward.’ Some examples are:

Paharap
sa kaniya ang bata.

Patalikod
is facing )

‘The child him.’
has his back toward {

§4.21. Pseudo-verbs and pseudo-verb phirases.

There is a small class of adjectivals in Tagalog which have verb-like meanings, but which, unlike
genuine verbs, are incapable of inflection to show variation in aspect (cf. §2.7 for an introduction to verb
aspect). The members of this class of adjectivals may be called PSEUDO-VERBS. The eight Tagalog
pseudo-verbs are listed below, together with some of their more common English translation-equivalents:

ayaw /‘a'yaw/ ‘do(es)n’t like (to), wouldn’t like (to)’
kailangan /ka’ila‘nan/ ‘need(s) (to), ought to, must, should”
dapat /da‘pat/ ‘ought to, must, should’

gusto /gustoh/ ‘like(s) (to), would like (to), want(s) (to)’
ibig /*i-big/ ‘like(s) (to), would like (to), want(s) (to)’
maaari /nva’a‘a‘ri’/ ‘can, may, could, might’

nais /na‘’is/ ‘like(s) (to), would like (to), want(s) (to)’
puwede /pwe'deh/ ‘can, may, could, might’

As the translations show, certain of the pseudo-verbs are similar to one another in meaning: viz.,
kailangan and dapat; maaari and puwede; gusto, ibig, and nais. In construction types in which kailangan and
dapat both occur, kailangan often connotes internal necessity or need, dapat external necessity or
appropriateness. Thus, for example, while both Kailangang matalino ang titser and Dapat (na) matalino ang
titser may be translated ‘The teacher must be intelligent’, the former suggests that the teacher feels the need
to be intelligent, the latter that the situation requires that the teacher be intelligent. (There are two
formations, marapat {mara‘pat/ and nararapat na‘ra‘ra‘pat/, that occur as alternants of dapat. Marapat
alternates with dapat only in nominalizations (cf. §3.24): e.g., to ang dapat/marapat gawin ‘This is what
must be done’. Nararapat occurs in all the same constructions as dapat, but is more formal.)

Maaari and puwede, which both denote ability, permission, or possibility, are synonymous in all their
occurrences. Aaaari is common in both informal and formal contexts; puwede is common only in informal
contexts. (In addition to being used as pseudo-verbs, kailangan, maaari, and puwede are also used as
unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2). In this use kailangan means ‘necessary’, while miaaari and puwede mean
‘possible’. Examples are:

Kailangan
Maaari \ ba raw iyon?
Puwede
necessary?
‘Do they say that this is
possible?

j kailangan, )

Kung maaari, } aalis ako bukas.
l puwede, \
{ necessary,

‘If I'll leave tomorrow.”)
| possible,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
262 CHAPTER 4

Gusto, ibig and nais all denote preference or desire. The three differ from one another in level of
usage, and, in some cases, in connotation as well. Gusto is the most common of the three; ibig is more
formal than gusto, and occurs more frequently in writing than in speech; nais is the most formal, and is rare
in ordinary conversation. In some construction types, ibig and nais specify progressively stronger
preferences than does gusto. Thus, while Gusto kong umalis, [big kong umalis, and nais kong umalis may all
be translated ‘I want to leave’, the first suggests anything from a mild inclination to a strong desire, the
second suggests at least a fairly strong desire, and the third only a strong desire. In other construction types,
gusto and ibig have more or less identical ranges of meaning, while nais again specifies a strong preference.
Thus Gusto ko iyon and [big ko iyon both mean ‘I (would) like that’ or ‘I want that’, without specifying
the strength of the preference, while Nais ko iyon suggests ‘I (would) like that very much’ or ‘I want that
very much’.

Ayaw serves as the contrary of gusto, ibig, and nais, and is similar in meaning to the negator hindi (cf.
§7.13) plus any one of these three. Thus Ayaw ni Juang punuinta ‘Juan doesn’t want to go’ is equivalent to
Hindi gustofibig/nais ni Juang pumunta.

In any constructions in which a pseudo-verb occurs, its meaning may be intensified through the use of
a construction in which the pseudo-verb is repeated, with the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) preceding the second
occurrence. (The construction is identical with the first adjective-intensification construction discussed in
§4.12.) Intensification of the pseudo-verb adds some such meaning as ‘really’ or ‘very much’ to the
meaning of the pseudo-verb itself: e.g.,

kailangang-kailangan ‘really need(s) (to), need(s) (to)...very much"

The intensive formations corresponding to the other pseudo-verbs are: ayaw na ayaw, dapat na dapat,
gustong-gusto, ibig na ibig, maaaring-maaari, nais na nais, and puwedeng-puwede. (The intensive formations
corresponding to dapat, maaari, nais, and puwede are relatively rare.)

Pseudo-verbs occur in sentence-initial position in a fairly wide range of constructions. (Like other
adjectivals, pscudo-verbs also occur in various non-sentence-initial positions: ¢.g., in nominalizations, after
ang, ng, or sa (cf. §3.24), in modification constructions (cf. §3.14), etc.) These constructions may be
grouped into eight main construction types: viz.,

(1) pseudo-verb phrase plus definite object

(2) pseudo-verb phrase plus indefinite object

(3) pseudo-verb phrase plus directional object

(4) _ pseudo-verb plus object plus topic

(5) pseudo-verb phrase plus linker, etc., plus clause

(6) _ pseudo-verb phrase plus linker plus basic form

(7)  pseudo-verb plus linker plus AF basic form plus topic
(8) pseudo-verb plus linker, etc., plus clause

Five of the eight construction types begin with a PPEUDO-VERB PHRASE. A pseudo-verb phrase consists
of a pseudo-verb and a ng phrase (ng plus an unmarked noun, ni(na) plus a personal noun, or the ng-form of
a personal or deictic pronoun.) The ng phrase corresponds to the subject of the verb that translates the
pseudo-verb in the English equivalents: ¢.g.,

Kailangan ng Amerikano iyon.
‘The American needs that.”

By analogy with ng phrases of similar meaning that occur in verbals, the xg phrase in a pseudo-verb phrase
may be called the ACTOR COMPLEMENT of the pseudo-verb. (The pseudo-verb ayaw contracts with the
actor complement ko /koh/ — the ng-form of the first person singular pronoun — to form a single
word: ayoko /’ayo'koh/ ‘I don’t like/want (to)’.

None of the pseudo-verbs occurs in all eight of the listed construction types. Ayaw occurs in
construction types (1) through (7), kailangan in construction types (1), (2), and (5) through (8). Gusto,

ibig, and nais occur in construction types (1) through (3) and (5) through (7). Dapat, maaari, and puwede
occur only in construction type (8).

The construction lypes are presented below in the order listed.

(1) PSEUDO-VERB PHRASE PLUS DEFINITE OBJECT. Any pseudo-verb but dapat, maaari, and
puwede may occur in this construction (and in the following one). The construction consists of a
pseudo-verb phrase (pseudo-verb plus actor complement — see above) followed by a phrase that is
translated by a definite object (‘the’ plus noun, etc.) in the English equivalents. Normally, this phrase is an
ang phrase (ang plus an unmarked noun, si(na) plus a personal noun, or the ag form of a personal or
deictic pronoun): e.g.,

Kailangan
Gusto
Ibig ni Pedro ang libro.
Nais
Ayaw
needs
‘Pedro likes/wants the book.’
doesn’t like/want
Kailangan
Gusto}
Ibig namin iyon.
Nas |
Ayaw
( need
‘We like/want that.’

don’t like/want

If the pseudo-verb is gusto or ayaw, an animate definite object (person or animal) may — or, in some
cases, for some speakers, must — be expressed by a sa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form
of a personal pronoun, kay/kina plus a personal noun, or the sa form of a deictic pronoun). Thus most
speakers may use either an ang phrase or a sa phrase to express the definite object in such sentences as:

ang
Gusto ni Pedro titser,
sa
‘Pedro likes the teacher.”

{ ang
Ayaw ni Pedro titser.

sa
‘Pedro doesn’t like the teacher.”

(Some speakers allow the replacement of the ang phrase by asa phrase only after ayaw. For these speakers,
“Pedro likes the teacher’ cannot be expressed by Gusto ni Pedro sa titser.)

For many speakers the replacement of the ang phrase by a sa phrase after ayaw is obligatory if the
definite object is expressed by a personal noun or personal pronoun. For these speakers ‘I don’t like
Pedrofhiny is:

kay Pedro.
Ayoko
sa kaniya.
rather than:
{ si Pedro.
Ayoko
| siya.

264 CHAPTER 4

Other speakers, however, may use either a sa phrase or an ang phrase in these cases. (Certain sentences of
the shape gusto/ayaw-plus-ng- phrase-plus-sa-phrase are ambiguous. In these sentences, the sa phrase may be
interpreted either as a definite object or as a directional object. For example, Avoko Kay Pedro may mean
either ‘I don’t like Pedro’ or ‘I don’t like to gof/come to Pedro's’, I don’t like to be at Pedro’s’. In the latter
interpretations, the sentence represents the pscudo-verb-phrase-plus-directional-object construction dealt
with under (3) below.)

(2) PSEUDO-VERB PHRASE PLUS INDEFINITE OBJECT. In this construction, the pscudo-verb
phrase is followed by a ng phrase that is translated by an indefinite object (‘a/an’ plus noun, ‘some’ plus
noun, etc.) in the English equivalent. The zg phrase representing the indefinite object must be either ag plus
an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun. (Personal nouns and personal pronouns always

express meanings of definiteness, and thus do not occur in this construction.) Some examples are:

Kailangan
Gusto )
Ibig ng bata ng lapis.
Nais j
Ayaw
{ needs }
‘The:child wants/would like a pencil.”
doesn’t want j
Kailangan
Gusto
Ibig niya nito.
Nais
Ayaw
needs some )
“He wants/would like some of this.”
doesn’t need any j

(3) PSEUDO-VERB PHRASE PLUS DIRECTIONAL OBJECT. In this construction, a pseudo-verb
phrase with gusto, ibig, nafs, or ayaw is followed by a sa phrase that represents a place toward which the
actor (i.e., the referent of the actor complement) ‘wants’ or ‘doesn't want’, etc., to move, or a place at/in
which he ‘wants’ or ‘doesn’t want’, to be. (If the noun in the sa phrase designates a person, the sa phrase
represents a place associated with that person — usually his home.) In the English equivalents of the
construction, the translation-equivalent of the pseudo-verb is usually followed by ‘to go/come to —’ or ‘to

 

be at/in *, Some examples of the construction are:

Gusto

Ibig
ng Nanay sa tindahan.

Nais

Ayaw
wants/likes/would like go/come to

‘Mother to the store.”
doesn’t want/like be in

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 265

Gusto’
{ Ibig
\ nila kay Maria.
Nais
Ayaw
\ want/like/would like ) ( go/come to }
‘They

to Maria's.
don’t want/like ( | be at j

(As was previously noted, sentences like Ayaw nila kay Maria are ambiguous, since kay Maria can be
interpreted either as a definite object — see construction type (1), above — or as a directional object. In the
former interpretation, the sentence means ‘They don’t like Maria’.)

(4) PSEUDO-VERB PLUS OBJECT PLUS TOPIC. The pseudo-verb ayaw occurs in three
constructions in which jt is not followed by a ng-phrase actor complement. In these constructions the
‘actor’ (i.e.. the person who ‘doesn’t like/want’) is expressed by the topic of the sentence, an ang phrase.
Two of the constructions are presented here. (The third is presented in subsection (7), below.) In one, the
sentence includes, in addition to ayaw and the topic, a ng phrase that serves as the indefinite object of
ayaw: ¢.g.,

Ayaw ng mansanas si Juan.
“Juan doesn’t like apples.”

In the other, the sentence includes a sa phrase that serves as the directional object of ayaw. (As in
construction type (3), above, the English equivalent normally involves ‘to go/come to’ or ‘to be in/at’). For
example:

Ayaw sa tindahan si Juan.
to go/come to

‘Juan doesn’t like the store.’
to be in

(The order of the topic phrase and the object phrase is in most cases free. Thus, also: Ayaw si Juan ng
mansanas and Ayaw si Juan sa tindahan, \f, however, the topic is the ang form of a personal pronoun, it
obligatorily precedes the object phrase: Ayaw siya ng mansanas ‘He doesn’t like apples’, Ayaw siya sa
tindahan ‘He doesn't like to be in the store’.)

For all constructions of the type just presented, there is a construction of identical meaning in which
ayaw is followed by an actor complement. Thus, Ayaw ni Juan ng mansanas (construction type (2), above)
is identical in meaning with Ayaw ng mansanas si Juan, and Ayaw ni Juan sa tindahan (construction type
(3)) is identical in meaning with Ayaw sa tindahan si Juan.

(A few speakers allow gusto, as well as ayaw in pseudo-verb-plus-object-plus-topic constructions.
These speakers may use sentences such as Gusto ng mansanas si Juan ot Gusto sa tindahan si Juan. This is,
however, definitely a minority usage.)

(5) PSEUDO-VERB PHRASE PLUS LINKER, ETC., PLUS CLAUSE. Any pseudo-verb but dapat,
maaari, and puwede may occur in this construction (and in the following one). In the English equivalent,
the counterpart of the pseudo-verb phrase is followed by an object plus ‘to’ plus a verb or by a possessive
plus the ‘-ing’ form of a verb: ¢.g.,

Nanay ay
Nanay,
Gusto ng narito siya.
Nanay, ay
Nanay (na)

‘Mother wants him to be here.”
‘Mother likes his being here.’

266 CHAPTER 4

As the example shows, a clause following a pseudo-verb phrase may in most cases be preceded by 4
linker, by the inversion-marker ay (cf. §7.2), by a pause, or by a pause plus ay. A clause following a
pseudo-verb phrase with ayaw, however, is always preceded by a linker. (Hereafter, all examples show a
linker before the clause. In cach case, unless the pscudo-verb is ayaw, or unless otherwise specified, it is to
be understood that ay; etc., may also occur.) Some speakers use only the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) in this
construction, others either the linker na/-ng or the linker -ng (cf. §3.8). (This means that, if the word
preceding the linker ends, in its independent form, in one of the phonemes /’/, /h/, or /n/, the linker is, for
all speakers, manifested as an /n/ replacing this phoneme. But when the word preceding the linker does not
end in /"/, {h/, or /n/, some speakers always use an overt linker (na /na/), while others may or may not use
an overt linker.)

The clause that follows the linker, etc., has its own predicate and topic. If the predicate is an
adjectival (as in the examples given previously) or a nominal, the clause has the same form that it would
have as an independent sentence. Thus:

Kailangang kong naroon siya.
‘I need him (to be) there.”
(cf. Naroon siya.

“He is there.’)

Gusto kong lalaki ang bata.
‘I want the child to be a boy.”
(cf. Lalaki ang bata.

‘The child is a boy.’)

If the predicate of the clause is a verbal, the verb within it ordinarily loses the aspect marking that it would
have in an independent sentence, and the basic form of the verb (which consists of the basic form of an
affix plus a verb base — cf. §2.8) is used instead. Thus:

Kailangan kong magluto ng pagkain si Maria.
‘need Maria to cook some food.’

Magluluto
(cf. ( Nagluluto ng pagkain si Maria.
Nagluto
will cook )
‘Maria is cooking some food.’
cooked {
Gusto kong lutuin ni Maria ang pagkain.
would like
‘I Maria to cook the food.’
want
Lulutuin
(cf. 4 Niluluto ni Maria ang pagkain.
Niluto
will cook
‘Maria is cooking the food.’ )
cooked

Many speakers allow the basic form of the verb in a clause after a pseudo-verb to be replaced by one
of the two aspect-marked forms that include a duplicating syllable: the contemplated form and the

ElaAmante enc Arnite Aautour

 
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 267

imperfective form (cf. §§5.19 and 5.20). For these speakers, the aspect-marked forms are used, in this
construction, to connote regular or frequent occurrence of the action expressed by the verb. The
contemplated form connotes that the action has not yet occurred, but is to occur regularly or frequently in
the future: e.g.,

Gusto kong lulutuin ni Maria ang pagkain.
\ cook
‘I would like Maria to the food (regularly).’

( start cooking

The imperfective form connotes that the action has already occurred, and is to continue occurring regularly
or frequently: e.g.,

Gusto kong niluluto ni Maria ang pagkain.
cook
‘L would like Maria to the food (regularly).

} continue cooking

(Some speakers use the aspect-marked forms of the verb after ayaw, but not after the other pseudo-verbs.
Such speakers would not use sentences of the kind just illustrated, but might say:

lulutuin )

Ayaw kong ni Maria ang pagkain.
niluluto

‘I don’t want Maria to cook the food (regularly).’)

When the clause is preceded by a linker (rather than ay, etc.) and has the basic fonn of an actor-focus
verb in predicate position, its topic may optionally be moved to a position before the linker. (The topic of
the clause cannot be moved to a position before the linker except under the circumstances specified. Thus,
when the predicate of the clause is a nominal, an adjectival, a basic or inflected form of a goal-focus verb, or
an inflected form of an actor-focus verb, its topic cannot precede the linker.) For example, si Maria, the
topic of the clause in Kailangan kong magluto ng pagkain si Maria, may be moved to a position before the
linker, to produce:

Kailangan ko si Mariang magluto ng pagkain.
‘I need Maria to cook some food.”

The placement of the topic of an actor-focus basic form before the linker is particularly common when the
topic is a marked noun (cf. §3.2), but may also occur when the topic is an unmarked noun. Thus the
following all occur, but the example with ang barang represents a less common sentence-type than do the
others.

silang,
si Juang
Gusto ko mag-aral mamayang gabi.
iyong
ang batang

them
Juan
‘l want to study tonight.’
that one
the child

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
268 CHAPTER 4

(When the ang form of a personal pronoun is moved to a position before the linker, it is enclitic to the
pseudo-verb, and takes its usual enclitic position in relation to other enclitic and non-enclitic sentence

elements (cf. §3.29). Compare, for example, the position of sila in the example above and in the following
one:

Gusto sila ng Nanay (na) mag-aral mamayang gabi.
(Mother wants them to study tonight.’)

In the usage of some speakers, the construction with the topic before the linker shows a potential
difference in connotation from the construction in which the entire clause follows the linker. For these
speakers, the construction in which the topic precedes the linker may direct more attention to the topic
than does the other construction. For example, the sentence Kailangan ko si Mariang magluto ng pagkain
may suggest the paraphrase:

Kailangan ko si Maria. Magluluto siya ng pagkain.
‘I need Maria. She will cook the food.”

while the sentence Kailangan kong magluto ng pagkain si Maria suggests the paraphrase:

May kailangan ako: ang pagluluto ni Maria ng pagkain.
‘I need something: for Maria to cook the food.’

(6) PSEUDO-VERB PHRASE PLUS LINKER PLUS BASIC FORM. In this construction, a
pseudo-verb phrase is followed by a linker plus the basic form of a verb, plus, in some cases (see below), the
complement(s) and/or the topic of the verb. In the English equivalent, the counterpart of the pscudo-verb
phrase is followed by ‘to’ plus a verb: e.g.,

kong
Gusto mangisda.
ni Bob (na)
“I want
to go fishing.”
‘Bob wants

(As in the case of construction type (5), above, some speakers use only the linker na/-ng in this
construction, while others use either na/-ng or -ng.)

This construction is related to the construction presented above (subsection (5)) in which a
pseudo-verb phrase is followed by a linker plus a clause with a basic-form-verbal predicate: e.g., Gusto
kong mangisda siya ‘I want him to go fishing’. The construction under discussion may be described as being
derived from the previously presented construction through the obligatory deletion of the word or phrase
that expresses the actor after the basic form, where this word or phrase has the same referent as the actor
complement of the pseudo-verb. Thus Gusto kong mangisda may be said to be derived from *Gusto kong
mangisda ako ‘I want (me) to go fishing’. If, as in this example, the basic form is actor focus, its topic is
deleted. If the basic form is goal focus, its actor complement is deleted: e.g.,

Gusto kong paroonan ang palengke.
‘I want to go to the market.’

(cf. Gusto kong paroonan niya ang palengke.
‘I want him to go to the market.’)

ElaAmante ene Arnite dtanitoeur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 269

An actor-focus verb in this construction may be followed by any of its normal complements (cf.
§§2.1] and 5.12), a goal-focus verb by any of its normal complements other than an actor
complement: e.g.,

Ayokong magpalagay kay Juan ng bakod doon.
‘I don’t want to have Juan put a fence there.’

(cf. Magpapalagay ako kay Juan ng baked doon.
‘I will have Juan put a fence there.”

Kailangan kong isulat ang Tatay ng liham kay Ricardo.
‘I need to write a letter to Ricardo for Father.’

(cf. Isusulat ko ang Tatay ng liham kay Ricardo.
‘I will write a letter to Ricardo for Father.")

When the actor complement of the pseudo-verb is a personal pronoun, it always precedes the linker,
When, however, it is something other than a personal pronoun, it may optionally be moved to a position
after the basic form. Thus Gustong mangisda ni Bob is an optional variant of Gusto ni Bob (na) mangisda.

When the topic of a goal-focus basic form in this construction is a personal pronoun, it is enclitic to
the pseudo-verb (cf. §3.29), and is obligatorily moved to a position before the linker. Thus:

Gusto ko siyang tawagin.
‘I want to call him.’

not:
*Gusto kong tawagin siya.
When the topic of a goal-focus basic form is something other than a personal pronoun, it may optionally be

moved to a position before the linker. The pre-linker position is common in the case of personal-name and
deictic-pronoun topics, less common in the case of unmarked-noun topics. Examples are:

j si Juang
Gusto ko iyong tawagin.
l ang doktor (na)
{ Juan.’
‘I want to call that one.’

l the doctor.’

(Gusto ko ang doktor (na) tawagin represents a less common sentence type than do the others. The
examples are optional variants of:

{ si Juan.
Gusto kong tawagin iyon.

ang doktor.)

(7) PSEUDO-VERB PLUS LINKER PLUS AF BASIC FORM PLUS TOPIC. As was noted in
subsection (6) above, a construction like Ayokong mangisda ‘I don’t want to go fishing’ may be described
as being derived from *Ayokong mangisda ako ‘1 don’t want (me) to go fishing’, through deletion of an
actor topic that has the same referent as the actor complement of the pseudo-verb. In some cases, there is
an alternative construction in which the actor topic is retained and the actor complement of the

pseudo-verb is absent. This alternative construction has the shape: pseudo-verb plus linker plus actor-focus

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
270 CHAPTER 4

basic form plus topic: e.g., Ayaw (na) mangisda sila. (As in construction type (6), some speakers use only
the linker na/-ng in this construction, while others use cither this or the linker -ng. The actor topic may
optionally be moved to a position before the linker in all cases: thus, also, Ayaw silang mangisda.)

The construction under discussion is a common alternative to the construction with the deleted actor
topic only if the pseudo-verb is ayaw. If the pseudo-verb is kailangan, gusto, ibig, or nais, the construction is
in some cases acceptable, in others marginally acceptable, and in stil! others unacceptable. The construction
is unacceptable to most speakers if the actor is expressed by a personal pronoun. Thus *Gusto siyang
pununta sa tindahan (or *Gustong pumunta siya sa tindahan) docs not occur as an alternative to Gusto
niyang pumunta sa tindahan ‘He wants to go to the store’. If the actor is expressed by something other than
a personal pronoun, the construction is apparently most acceptable if the verb is followed by a directional
and/or object complement (cf. §2.11), less acceptable or unacceptable if there is no complement. Thus
most speakers do not accept *Gustong pumunta ang nanay, but do accept Gustong pumunta sa tindahan
ang nanay ‘Mother wants to go to the store’. (The sentence is equivalent to Gusto ng nanay (na) pumunta sa
tindahan.) Similarly, Kailangang kumain si Pedro is not acceptable to most speakers in the meaning of
Kailangan ni Pedrong kumain ‘Pedro needs to eat’. (Kailangang kumain si Pedro is a grammatical sentence,
but it) means, literally, ‘It is necessary for Pedro to cat’, and is an example of the
pseudo-verb-plus-linker-plus-clause construction dealt with under (8), below.) Kailangang kurmain ng kame
si Pedro is, however, acceptable in the meaning of Kailangan ni Pedrong kumain ng karne ‘Pedro needs to
eat meat’. (Kailanang kwnain ng kame si Pedro also occurs as an example of the
pseudo-verb-plus-linker-plus-clause construction, in the literal meaning ‘It is necessary for Pedro to eat
meat’.)

(8) PSEUDO-VERB PLUS LINKER, ETC. PLUS CLAUSE. The pseudo-verbs that occur in this
construction are kailangan, dapat, maaari and puwede. Their literal meanings in the construction
are: kailangan ‘it is necessary (for)’, dapat ‘it is fitting (for)’, miaaari and puwede ‘it is possible
(for/that)’; ¢.g.,

Kailangang lider si Juan.
‘It is necessary for Juan to be a leader.’

Dapat (na) lider si Juan.
‘It is fitting for Juan to be a leader.’

Maaaring/Puwedeng lider si Juan.

for Juan to be a leader.”
‘It is possible

that Juan is a leader.’

Usually, however, kailangan and dapat are more freely translatable by an auxiliary verb such as ‘ought to’,
‘must’, or should’, and maaari and puwede by an auxiliary verb such as ‘can’, ‘may’, ‘could’, or ‘might’.

A clause following kailangan or dapat may be preceded by a linker, by the inversion marker ay, by a
pause, or by a pause plus ay; a clause following saaari or puwede is always preceded by a linker. (Once
more, some speakers use only the linker na/-ng, others either this or the linker ng.) Thus there are sentences
like:

Kailangan/Dapat ay lider si Juan.
but there is no:

*Maaari/Puwede ay lider si Juan.

The clause in this construction may be any normal statement type, with its own predicate and topic.
If the predicate is a verbal, the basic form of the verb, as well as any of the three aspect-marked forms, may
be used. When the pseudo-verb in the construction is kailangan or dapat, verb-form usage is as follows:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 271

(a) the basic form is used in speaking of actions that should occur in the future, or that should occur
regularly:

Kailangang

magbasa ng libro bukas si Pedro.
Dapat (na)
‘Pedro should read a book tomorrow.’
Kailangang)

magbasa ng libro araw-araw si Pedro.
Dapat (na) {

‘Pedro should read a book every day.’

(b) The contemplated form is used in speaking of actions that should occur regularly starting at some
time in the future:

Kailangang

magbabasa ng mga libro si Pedro
Dapat (na)
‘Pedro should start reading books.”

(c) The imperfective form is used in speaking of actions that should be occurring at present or that
should continue to occur:

Kailangang)

nagbabasa ng libro ngayon si Pedro.
Dapat (na)
‘Pedro should be reading a book now.”
Kailangang

nagbabasa ng libro araw-araw si Pedro.
Dapat (na)

‘Pedro should continue to read a book every day.’

(d) The perfective form is used in speaking of actions that should have occurred in the past:

Kailangang

nagbasa ng libro si Pedro.
Dapat (na)
‘Pedro should have read a book.”

When the pseudo-verb in the construction is maaari or puwede, verb-form usage is as follows:

(a) the basic form is used to express a possible action without specifying whether it is thought of as
begun and/or completed:

Maaaring
gawin iyon ni Pedro.
Puwedeng
‘Pedro can do that.’
(‘It is possible for Pedro to do that.’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
272 CHAPTER 4

(b) the inflected forms carry their usual meanings:

gagawin
Maaaring )

ginagawa iyon ni Pedro.
Puwedeng {

ginawa

{ will do
“It is possible that Pedro is doing that.”
did

If a basic form occurs in the predicate of the clause and is preceded by a linker (i.e., is not, in the case
of kailangan and dapat, preceded by ay, etc.), any enclitic pronouns within the clause may be moved to a
position before the linker. If the pseudo-verb is kailangan or dapat, the placement of enclitic pronouns
before the linker is always optional: thus Kailangan akong mag-Ingles is an optional variant of Kailangang
mag-Ingles ako ‘I should speak English’, and Dapat ko siyang makausap is an optional variant of Dapat (na)
makausap ko siya ‘I should talk to him’. If the pseudo-verb is maaari or puwede and the basic form is
goal-focus, the placement of enclitic pronouns before the linker is also optional: thus Maaari/Puwede ko
siyang makausap is an optional variant of Maaaring/Puweding makausap ko siya. If, however, the
pseudo-verb is maaari or puwede and the basic form is actor-focus, the placement of enclitic pronouns
before the linker is obligatory: thus Maaari/Puwede akong mag-Ingles ‘| can speak English’ (not
"*Maaaring/Puwedeng mag: Ingles ako).

When an actor-focus basic form follows the linker, and its topic is something other than a personal
pronoun, the topic may in all cases optionally precede the linker. Thus:

Kailangan
Dapat }
ang alkaldeng mag-Ingles.

Maaari \
Puwede

are optional variants of:

Kailangang
Dapat (na) }

mag-Ingles ang alkalde.
Maaaring
nome

should
‘The mayor speak English.”
can

In the case of dapat, maaari, and puwede (but not kailangan), the topic of a nominal or adjectival
predicate may also be moved to a position before the linker. If the pseudo-verb is dapat, the meaning is not
affected. Thus:

lider
Dapat si Juang
mabait.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 273

vs
lider)
Dapat (na) si Juan.
mabait {
{ aleader.”
‘Juan should be
good.”

If the pseudo-verb is maaari or puwede, the placement of the topic before the linker resolves a potential
ambiguity. The sentence Maaaring lider si Juan, for example, can be taken to mean either ‘It is possible for
Juan to be a leader’ or ‘It is possible that Juan is a leader’. That is, it may refer either to a hypothetical
possibility or to the possibility that a given situation actually obtains. The sentence Maaari si Juang lider, on
the other hand, means only ‘It is possible for Juan to be a leader’, and refers unambiguously to a
hypothetical possibility. Similarly Pawede si Juang mabait ‘It is possible for Juan to be good’ refers to a
hypothetical possibility while Puwedeng mabait si Juan may refer either to a hypothetical possibility or to
the possibility that a given situation actually obtains (in which case it has the meaning, ‘It is possible that
Juan is good*.) (When the topic of a nominal or adjectival after maaari plus linker or puwede plus linker is a
personal pronoun, it may not be moved to a position before the linker unless the speaker wishes to refer to
a hypothetical possibility. Thus Maaaring/Puwedeng lider siya means only ‘It is possible that he is a leader’,
and the meaning ‘It is possible for him to be a leader’ is expressible only by Maaari/Puwede siyang lider.)

(In yes-no questions — cf. $7.4 —snaaari and puwede (plus the interrogative particle ba) plus a linker
are sometimes followed by a basic form that is not accompanied by any expression of the actor. These
questions imply either an indefinite actor or a first-person-pronoun actor: ¢.g.,

Maaari/Puwede bang umalis ngayon?
one

‘May I leave now?’
we

Maaari/Puwede bang basahin iyon?

j one
‘Can I read that?’)

§4.22. Possessive sa and may phrases.

The possessive phrases dealt with in the present section are phrases that may occur as predicates of
basic or derived sentences. (In addition to these phrases, which may be called POSSESSIVE PREDICATES,
Tagalog has certain other constructions expressing possession that are discussed under the heading
POSSESSIVE MODIFIERS in §3.20.) Possessive predicates are of two main types, which may be called
POSSESSIVE sa PHRASES and POSSESSIVE may PHRASES. Possessive sa phrases occur as predicates of
sentences expressing possession of some specific, already-identified object or objects. The object possessed
is expressed by the topic of the sentence. If the nominal in the sa phrase has an animate referent, it
designates the owner of the object, and the sentence is often equivalent to an English sentence of the type

‘The _____ is/are ’s or ‘The belong(s) to *: e.g.

 

 

Sa Nanay ang relos.
{ ‘The watch is Mother’s.” \
‘The watch belongs to Mother.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
274 CHAPTER 4

If the nominal in the s@ phrase has an inanimate referent, it designates the place where the object
properly belongs (the place that “possesses” the object), and the sentence is equivalent to an English

’

 

 

sentence of the type ‘The belong(s)/go(es) infon t BQ,
{ kahon }
Sa ang relos.
| mesa \
{ in the box.’
‘The watch belongs/goes

| on the table.”

A possessive sa phrase may be any of the following: (1) sa plus an unmarked noun; (2) sa plus the sa
form of a personal pronoun; (3) the sa form of a personal pronoun without a preceding sa ((2) and (3)

alternate freely); (4) Kay (or its pluralized counterpart kina) plus a personal noun; (5) tne sa form of a
deictic pronoun, Examples are:

Sa Nanay
Sa skint
Akin ang relos.
Kay Pedro
Doon
Mother's’
mine.”
The watch is
Pedro’s.”

that one’s.”

Possessive may phrases occur as predicates of sentences expressing possession of some specific but not
previously identified object or objects. The object possessed is expressed in the may phrase, the owner by
the topic of the sentence. Sentences with possessive say phrase predicates are often equivalent to English
sentences of the type * has/have a/some T .8.5

 

 

May relos ang Nanay.
‘Mother has a watch.’

May pera ang Nanay.
‘Mother has some money.’

(The equivalent of an English sentence of the type * has/have the ‘ is often expressed in
Tagalog by a sentence with a locative-phrase predicate: ¢.g., Nasa Nanay ang relos. ‘Mother has the watch’
(more literally: ‘The watch is with Mother’) — cf. §4.19. The equivalent of an English sentence in which
‘has/have" is followed by an expression of quantity is often expressed in Tagalog by a sentence with a
limiter as predicate and a topic modified by a possessive modifier: ¢.g., Dalawa ang relos ng Nanay ‘Mother
has two watches’ (more literally: ‘Mother’s watches are two’) — cf. §3.22.

The label POSSESSIVE may PHRASE is used as a cover term for possessive phrases introduced by
any one of the following: may, mayroon, marami, wala. Phrases introduced by wala (which are negative in
meaning — e.g., Wala akong relos ‘1 don’t inave a watch’) are however, dealt with separately in §7.14.

May and mayroon are identical in meaning, and are often in free alternation. When, however, the
object possessed is expressed by a deictic pronoun, only sayraon is used, and it is followed by the ng form

of the deictic (cf. §3.4): ¢.g.,
nire
nito

Mayroon si Juan.
niyan
niyon/noon
this/these.”

‘Juan has some of
that/those.”

When the object possessed is expressed by something other than a deictic pronoun, either may or
mayroon may be used. May is always immediately followed by the word or phrase expressing the object
possessed. Mayroon, on the other hand, may be separated from this word or phrase by one or more enclitic
particles or pronouns (cf. §§3.29 and 6.2-6.6), and is always separated from it by the linker -ng (cf.
§3.8). (The tinker immediately precedes the word or phrase expressing the object possessed. If there are
enclitics present, the linker follows the last enclitic; if there are no enclitics, the linker is manifested as an
{nf replacing the final /n/ of mayroon.)

In sentences that do not include enclitic particles or pronouns, say is more common than mayroon.
Thus ‘Juan has a boat’ would usually be expressed as May bangka si Juan, rather than Mayroong bangka si
Juan. Sentences like the latter are grammatical, but relatively rare.

In sentences that include one or more enclitics, may and mayroon are equally common. Thus:

May bangka ba

si Juan?
Mayroon bang bangka
“Does Juan have a boat?’

{ May bangka ako. \
Mayroon akong bangka.

‘[ have a boat.”

A possessive phrase introduced by :narami expresses possession of a large quantity or number of an
object. As in the case of phrases introduced by mayroon, the object(s) possessed may be expressed either
by the ng form of a deictic pronoun or by an unmarked noun preceded by the linker -ng. (Once more, any
enclitic particles or pronouns obligatorily precede the linker.) Some examples are:

Marami noon si Juan.
‘Juan has a lot of that/those.”

Maraming pera si Juan.
‘Juan has a lot of moncy.”

Marami ba siyang pera?
“Does he have a lot of money?”

(Marami is also used as a limiter — cf. §3.22 — in which case it does not have a possessive meaning. Because
marami may have either a possessive or a non-possessive meaning, certain sentences that include it are
ambiguous. Thus Mfaraming pera iyon may mean either ‘That one has a lot of moncy’ or ‘That's a lot of
money’.)

§4.23. Indefinite and existential may phrases.

Apart from may phrases that express possession, may phrases that express meanings of two other
types occur in predicate position: these may be called INDEFINITE may PITRASES and EXISTENTIAL
may PHRASES. (Once more, say phrase is used as a cover term for phrases introduced by may, mayroon,
marami, or wala, with wala reserved for separate treatment in §7.14. In addition to phrase-types dealt with
in this and the preceding section, may ~ but not mayroon, marami, or wala — occurs after sa within
locative adjectival and adverbial phrases — cf. §§4.19 and 6.9.)

In indefinite phrases, may (or mayroon plus the linker -ag, marami plus the linker -ng) is followed by
an inflected form of a verb. If the verb in an indefinite may phrase predicate is an actor-focus verb (cf. §2.9
for a discussion of verb focus), the sentence has no topic. Sentences in which may or mayroon is followed
by an actor-focus verb are often equivalent to English sentences with an indefinite pronoun (‘someone’,
‘something’) as subject: e.g.,

{ darating bukas.
May dumarating araw-araw,
| dumating kahapon.

is coming tomorrow.”
‘Someone comes every day.’
came yesterday.”

mangyayari?
Mayroon bang nangyayari?
nangyari?

‘Will something happen?”
‘Is something happening?’
‘Did something happen?’

(May and mayroon show essentially the same distribution in sentences that include indefinite and
existential phrases that they show in sentences with possessive phrases. That is, may is preferred in
sentences that lack enclitis, while the two are equally common in sentences that include enclitics.)
Sentences in which marami is followed by an actor-focus verb are often equivalent to English sentences
with ‘a lot (of people/things)’ (or ‘lots (of peopte/things)’) as subject: e.g.,

Maraming darating bukas.
‘A lot (of people) are coming tomorrow.’

Marami bang mangyayari?
‘Will a lot (of things) happen?”

If the verb in an indefinite-»ay-phrase predicate is a goal-focus verb, the sentence has a topic, which
represents the performer of the action of the verb. (Note that the performer of the action is not expressed
by a vg-phrase actor complement, as it is in other constructions that involve goal-focus verbs. Compare, for
example:

May ginawa ang Amerikano.
‘The American did something.

and:

Ginawa ng Amerikano iyon.
‘The American did that.’) |
!

Sentences in which may or mayroon is followed by a goal-focus verb in the contemplated aspect (cf.
§2.7 for a discussion of verb aspects) are often equivalent either to English sentences in which ‘has/have’ is

 
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 277

followed by an indefinite pronoun (or the indefinite adverb ‘somewhere’) plus ‘to’ plus a verb — ¢.g., ‘Juan
has something to do’— or to sentences in which a verb is followed by an indefinite pronoun or
adverb — e.g., ‘Juan is going to do something": e.g.,

May gagawin si Juan.
has something to do.’
‘Juan

is going to do something.”

May susulatan ako.
have someone to write to.”
‘l
am going to write to someone.’

Mayroon siyang pupuntahan. «6
{ite has somewhere to go.” \
‘He is going somewhere.”

(When the verb refers to an action that was contemplated in the past, the usual English cquivalent involves
‘had’ plus an indefinite plus'to’plus a verb, or ‘was/were going to” plus a verb: e.g.,

May gagawin si Juan kahapon (pero hindi niya nagawa.)
\ had something to do
Juan yesterday (but he didn’t get to do it.)’)

l was going to do something

Sentences in which may or mayrvon is followed by a goal-focus verb in the imperfective or perfective
aspect are usually equivalent to English sentences in which a verb is followed by an indefinite form:

{ ginagawa
May si Juan doon.
l ginawa
{ does
‘Juan something there.”
{ai
pinupuntahan
Mayroon siyang araw-araw.’
pinuntahan
{ goes )
‘He somewhere every day.”

lam

Sentences in which marami is followed by a goal-focus verb may, if the verb is in the contemplated
aspect, be equivalent to English sentences in which ‘hasfhave a lot (of things/people/places)’ is followed by
‘to’ plus a verb — e.g., ‘Juan has a lot (of things) to do’. Or they may, regardless of the aspect of the verb,
be equivalent to English sentences in which a verb is followed by ‘a lot (of things/people/places)’ — ¢.g.,
‘Juan is going to do/does/did a lot (of things)’: e.g.,

Maraming gagawin si Juan.

{ ‘Juan has a lot (of things) to do.” }
‘Juan is going to do a lot (of things).”

278 CHAPTER 4

Marami akong sinusulatan awaw-araw.
‘I write to a lot (of people) every day."

Marami ka bang pinuntahan?
‘Did you go to a lot (of places)?”

Any of the various goal-focus types (object focus, directional focus, benefactive focus, etc. — cf.
§§2.9 and 5.7 through 5.12) may occur in an indefinite may phrase. The meaning of the verb in such a
phrase is essentially the same as its meaning when it occurs as a verbal predicate: e.g.,

May sinulat ako. (cf. Sinulat ko ang liham.

‘L wrote something.” ‘L wrote the Ietter.’)

May sinulatan ako. (cf. Sinulatan ko si Pedro.

‘I wrote to someone.’ ‘I wrote to Pedro.’)

May isinulat ako (ng liham). (cf.  Isinulat ko (ng liham) ang Nanay.
‘I wrote (a letter) for someone.’ ‘IL wrote (a letter) for Mother.)
May pinagsulatan ako. (cf. Pinagsulatan ko ang desk.

‘I wrote (it) somewhere.” ‘L wrote (it) on the desk.)

May ipinangsulat ako. (cf. Ipinangsulat ko ang lapis.

‘I wrote with something.’ ‘T wrote with the pencil.’)

(Instead of an inflected form of a verb, an indefinite may phrase may include a pseudo-verb — cf.
§4.21 — followed by the linker ng and the basic form of a goal-focus verb. Some examples are:

ayaw
kailangang
May dapat gawin si Juan.
gustong
ibig

doesn’t want to do anything.”
needs

‘Juan ought to do something.”
wants
wants

An indefinite may phrase may include, in addition to the verb (and its complements other than an
actor-complement), a noun that partially specifies the person, thing, place, etc., to which the verb refers.
This noun may cither precede or follow the verb (or verb phrase). In either case, the linker na/-ng
immediately precedes the second clement. As was mentioned above, the English equivalent of a sentence
whose predicate is an indefinite may phrase introduced by may or mayroon often includes an indefinite
pronoun or adverb. When a specifying noun is present, however, the English equivalent normally includes,
instead of an indefinite pronoun or adverb, an indefinite noun phrase: that is, a phrase consisting of *a/an"
or ‘some’ plus a noun. Thus:

istudyanteng dumating
May

kahapon.
dumating na istudyante

‘A student came yesterday.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 279

(cf. May dumating kahapon.
‘Someone came yesterday.’)

(mga) tindahang pinupuntahan

Mayroon siyang araw-araw.
pinupuntahang (mga) tindahan

“Ele goes to some stores every day.”

(cf. Mayroon siyang pinupuntahan araw-araw.
‘He goes somewhere every day.” )

(As was noted in §2.2, the topic of a Tagalog sentence always expresses a meaning of definiteness.
Therefore the predicate-plus-topic structure cannot in most cases express the equivalent of an English
sentence with an indefinite noun phrase as subject. The equivalent of such a sentence is instead commonly
expressed by a sentence with an indefinite say phrase that includes an actor-focus verb and a specifying
noun. Thus, while the English sentences ‘A student came’ and ‘The student came’ are highly similar in
structure, their Tagalog counterparts — May istudyanteng dumating and Dumating ang istudyante
respectively — are not.)

The presence of a specifying noun in an indefinite phrase introduced by maranti normally
corresponds to the presence of a phrase consisting of ‘a lot of or ‘lots of plus a noun in Engjish: e.g.,

trabahong gagawin

Maraming si Juan.
gagawing trabaho

“Juan has a lot of work to do.’

(cf. Maraming gagawin si Juan.
‘Juan has a lot to do.’)

A verb (or verb phrase) and a specifying noun within an indefinite may phrase need not occur in
immediate sequence. They may be separated by an adverb, by the topic of the sentence, etc. (In all cases,
however, whichever element — verb or specifying noun ~ is second is immediately preceded by the linker
na/-ng.) Thus, there are such sentences as:

istudyante kahapong dumating.
May

dumating kahapong istudyante.
‘A student came yesterday.”

trabaho si Juang gagawin.
Maraming

gagawin si Juang trabaho.
‘Juan has a lot of work to do.’

as well as sentences of the type previously exemplified.

Existential say phrases, like possessive may phrases (cf. §4.22), normally consist of may (or
mayroon plus the linker -rg, marami plus the linker -1g) followed by a noun. Sentences with
existential-phrase predicates differ from those with possessive-phrase predicates in the absence of a topic.
The sentence consists either of a may phrase alone or of a may phrase plus one or more adverbials.

Sentences with existential-phrase predicates introduced by say or mayroon are often equivalent to
English sentences in which initial ‘there’ is followed by some form of ‘be’ plus an indefinite noun
phrase -- e.g., ‘There’s a book on the table’, ‘There was a party yesterday’. (The ‘there’ in the equivalent
English sentences is unstressed. The Tagalog equivalent of sentences with stressed initial ‘there’ — ¢.g.,
‘There’s a bus’ (= ‘There comes a bus’) ~- begins with an attention-directing deictic ~ cf. §4.6 — rather than
an existential phrase.) Some examples are:

280 CHAPTER 4

May libro sa mesa.
‘There's a book on the table.”

May parti kahapon.
‘There was a party yesterday.”

Mayroon ding gatas.
‘There's some milk too.’

Sentences with existential-phrase predicates introduced by marami are often equivalent to English
sentences introduced by ‘there is/are’ etc., ‘alot of: ¢.g.,

Maraming pagkain.
‘There's a lot of food.’

Maraming trak sa daan.
‘There are a lot of trucks on the street.’

As in the case of possessive phrases, mayroon or marami ‘in existential phrases may be followed by the ag
form of a deictic pronoun, instead of by a linker plus a noun. (Once more, may does not occur before a
deictic.) For example:

Mayroon
nito roon.

Marami
some

‘There's of this there.’
alot

§4.24. Exclamatory sentences.

One-word exclamations, or interjections (e.g., Aba! ‘Oh!’; Aray! ‘Ouch!’), are presented in §7.23.
The present section is concerned with exclamatory sentences that have a more complex structure, and that
have a regular structural relation to non-exclamatory sentences with adjectival predicates.

Any statement that includes a ma- adjective as predicate (in normal initial position) is convertible into
an exclamation through a replacement of the prefix ma- by ang, kay, ka-, or ano plus the linker -ng and a
change of the topic ang phrase to a ng phrase. Thus:

Ang ganda
Maganda ang dalaga. Kay ganda }
‘The girl is beautiful.’ Kaganda

Anong ganda

‘How beautiful the girl is!"

ng dalaga!

Ang husay
Mahusay ang pagtuturo niya. Kay husay ng pagtuturo niya!
‘His teaching is good.’ Kahusay

Anong husay

(Some speakers do not use exclamations with ka-. Among speakers who do use such exclamations, some
prefer ka- with a short vowel (e.g., /kahusay/) while others use either a short vowel or a long vowel (e.g.,
/kahu'say/~/ka‘hu‘say/).)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 281

If the aa: adjective ia the undedlying statameat i& plurslized by duplication (@f. 84.11), the

pluralization is retained in the exclamatory sentence:

Ang tatangkad
Matatangkad sila. Kay tatangkad nila!
‘They are tall.’ Katatangkad

Anong tatangkad

‘How tall they are!”

In addition to ma- adjectives, certain unaffixed adjectives occur in exclamatory sentences introduced
by ang, kay, ka-, and anong. These are the same unaffixed adjectives that occur with the intensifying prefix
napaka- (i.c., most of the unaffixed adjectives that are not related to nouns with loss of penultimate vowel
length); they are discussed more fully in §§4.2 and 4.12. Some examples of exclamations involving
unaffixed adjectives are:

Ang luma
Luma ang bahay nila. Kay luma ng bahay nila!
‘Their house is old’ Kaluma

Anong luma

‘How old their house is!’

Ang asul
Asul ang langit. Kay asul ng langit!
‘The sky is blue.” Kaasul

Anong asul

‘How blue the sky is!”

As is the case when they follow napaka- (cf. §4.12), unaffixed adjectives in exclamations may be
pluralized by duplication. Thus:

Ang luluma

Kay luluma ng mga bahay nila!
Kaluluma

Anong luluma

‘How old their houses are!*

There are also a few nouns that occur after ang (but not after kay, ka-, or anong) in exclamations.
These are a small subclass of those nouns with penultimate vowel length that are related to adjectives
without penultimate length (cf. §4.2): ¢.g., gutom /gu'tom/ ‘hunger’ (cf. gutom/gu-tom/ ‘hungry’), pagod
{pa‘god/ ‘tiredness’ (cf. pagod {pagod/ ‘tired’), uhaw juhaw/ ‘thirst’ (cf. uhaw fuhaw/ ‘thirsty’). In
exclamations, these nouns convey an adjectival meaning. The exclamations are usually interpreted as
referring to a past condition (note the translations with ‘was’, below). Examples in sentences are:

Gutom /gutom/ gutom /gu‘tom/
Pagod /pagod/ 7? ako. > Ang pagod /pa‘god/ ?ko!
Uhaw /uhaw/ uhaw /u‘haw/

hungry.”
‘T'm tired.’

thirsty.”

hungry
‘How tired I was!”

thirsty

282 CHAPTER 4

Exclamations with ang, kay, and ka- (but not with anong) may be intensified by placing a disyllabic
duplicating prefix before the adjective (for rules of formation, cf. dup2-, §5.16), and, in the case of ka-,
changing the prefix to pagka- /pagka‘/. Thus:

Ang talino ng bata! > Ang tali-talino ng bata!

‘How intelligent the child is!” ‘How very intelligent the child is!”
Kay luma noon! > Kay luma-luma noon!

‘How old that is!” ‘How very old that is!”

Kabait ni Miss Santos! > Pagkabait-bait ni Miss Santos!
‘How kind Miss Santos is!” ‘How very kind Miss Santos is!”

(The kay and pagka- intensive constructions also occur in non-exclamatory sentences — cf. §4.12.) Some
speakers accept intensified exclamations with ka- as well as with pagka- in certain cases:

(Pag)katamis-tamis ng mangga!
“How sweet the mango is!”

To others, only the pagka- form is acceptable.

Adjective bases and adjectives that occur in exclamations may be followed by any of the usual
adjective complements (cf. §4.17). Some examples are:

Ang bagay (para) sa iyo ng barong iyan!
‘How becoming to you that dress is!’

Ang sipag niya sa trabaho!
‘How diligent he is at the work!’

Kay takaw ninyo ng kanin!
‘How voraciously you eat rice!”

Katamad (na) pumunta sa opisina ni Ben!
‘How lazy Ben is about going to the office!”

Anong lakas kumanta ni Petra!
‘How loudly Petra sings!”

Verbals and Their Expansions

 
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 283

§5.1. Introduction.

A preliminary discussion of Tagalog verbal constructions has been presented in § §2.6 through 2.12.
The major points covered in these sections are summarized immediately below, by way of introduction to
the more detailed treatment of verbal constructions offered in the present chapter.

A verb occurring in the predicate of a basic sentence may be analyzed as consisting of two
components: an aspect and a basic form. (In certain derived construction-types and sentence-types,
however, the basic form occurs alone: § §3.25, 5.30, etc.) The three verbal aspects found in basic
sentences are: the contemplated aspect, the imperfective aspect, and the perfective aspect. (A fourth verbal
aspect, the recent perfective, occurs only in derived sentences: cf. §5.23.) In general, the contemplated
aspect characterizes an event as not begun, the imperfective aspect as begun but not completed, and the
perfective aspect as completed. The aspect of a verb is indicated by inflection. That is, each aspectual
meaning is correlated with a different modification of the basic form of the verb.

The basic form itself consists of a verbal affix and a verb base. The affix may be a prefix (¢.g., miag-),
an infix (e.g., -rt-), a suffix (e.g., -in), or a complex affix consisting of both a prefix and a suffix (e.g.,
Pag-...-an). Affixes that may occur in the predicate verb of a basic sentence are called major affixes, and
the verbs in which they occur, major verbs. All other verbal affixes are called derived affixes, and the verbs
in which they occur, derived verbs.

The second component of a basic form, the base, expresses the core of meaning of the verb. A given
base may occur in two or more major verbs, as well as in a number of derived verbs. No general rules can be
given for the occurrence or non-occurrence of a base with any particular major affix. However, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of a base with a particular derived affix can in many cases be predicted once
it is known what major affix(es) the base occurs with.

The semantic relation of a predicate verb to a sentence topic varies with the focus of the verb, a
feature associated with the verbal affix. Certain affixes characteristically occur in actor-focus (AF)
verbs: verbs whose topics express the performer of the action. Others characteristically occur in goal-focus
(GF) verbs: verbs whose topics express the goal, etc., of the action. (‘‘Goal-focus” is used as a cover term
for all non-actor-focus verbs.) A major verb may be AF, or may belong to one of two classes of GF
verbs: object-focus (OF) verbs, and directional-focus (DF) verbs; the distinction between these two classes
is explained below. (There are also a number of classes of GF verbs that occur only in derived
sentences: cf. § §5.7 through 5.11, and §5.12, subsection (2).)

Some verbal predicates include, in addition to the verb itself, one or more complements. A
complement of a major verb is one of certain structures that stand in a non-focus relation to the verb, but
that correspond to the topic of a related major verb formed with the same base. Major verbs are divisible
into two classes on the basis of whether or not they accept complements. Those major verbs that accept
complements are transitive; those that do not, intransitive. (Derived verbs may also be classified as transitive
or intransitive. In the case of derived verbs, however, the basis of classification is the transitiveness or
intransitiveness of the major verbs from which they are derived. Certain derived verbs — c.g., causative-focus
verbs derived from major intransitive verbs (cf. §5.8) — are thus classified as intransitive even though they
accept a complement.)

Three types of complements occur in basic sentences: the actor complement (which is expressed by a
ng phrase), the object complement (which is also expressed by a ng phrase), and the directional
complement (which is expressed by a sa phrase). An actor complement corresponds to the topic of a related
AF verb; an object complement corresponds to the topic of a related OF verb; and a directional
complement corresponds to the topic of a related DF verb. (It is the correspondence of their topics to
object complements and directional complements respectively that is the basis for the distinction made
between OF and DF verbs.)

Every major transitive verb is a member of a set of verbs with a common base, which differ from one
another in focus but are otherwise identical in meaning. Each of these sets includes one AF verb, and the
sets may be assigned to one of three classes (complement classes) on the basis of the type of complement(s)
this AF verb accepts. If the AF verb accepts an object complement (but not a directional complement), the
set belongs to the object-verb complement class; if the AF verb accepts a directional complement (but not
an object complement), the set belongs to the directional-verb complement class; and if the AF verb accepts
both an object complement and a directional complement, the set belongs to the double-object-verb
complement class.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
284 CHAPTER 5.

Each set of object verbs includes, in addition to the AF verb, an OF verb (which accepts an actor
complement). Each set of directional verbs includes, in addition to the AF verb, a DF verb (which also
accepts an actor complement). And each set of double-object verbs includes, in addition to the AF verb, an
OF and a DF verb. (The OF verb belonging to such a set accepts an actor complement and a directional
complement; the DF verb belonging to such a set accepts an actor complement and an object complement.)

Every base that occuss in a set of major transitive verbs belongs to an affix-correspondence class.
(Some bases occur in more than one such class.) The affix-correspondence class to which a base belongs is
determined by the set of major affixes (or affix set) with which it occurs in verbs of differing focus but
otherwise identical meaning. An affix set that corresponds to a set of object verbs consists of an AF affix
(i.e., an affix that forms an AF verb) and an OF affix. An affix set that corresponds to a set of directional
verbs consists of an AF affix and a DF affix. And an affix set that corresponds to a set of double-object
verbs consists of an AF affix, an OF affix, and a DF affix.

The remaining sections of the present chapter are arranged as follows. §5.2 presents a survey of major
affixes. This is followed by a presentation of the classes of major verbs: object-verb classes (5.3),
directional—verb classes (5.4), double—object—verb classes (5.5), and intransitive—verb classes (5.6). The
next group of sections is devoted to derived verbs: first, those verbs that differ in focus from major
verbs: benefactive—focus verbs (5.7), causative—focus verbs (5.8), locative—focus verbs (5.9),
reservational—focus and instrumental—focus verbs (5.10), and referential—focus verbs (5.11); then other
types of derived verbs: indirect—action verbs (5.12), ability and involuntary—action verbs (5.13), social
verbs (5.14), pluralized verbs (5.15), and other derived verbs (5.16). A summary of verbal affixes is
presented in §5.17. §5.18 deals with base formations, § §5.19 through 5.23 with aspect formations: the
contemplated aspect (5.19), the imperfect aspect (5.20), the perfective aspect (5.21), a summary of basic
aspect formations (5.22), and the recent—perfective aspect (5.23). Irregular verbs formations are dealt with
in §5.24. §5.25 presents further information about verb complements (supplementing the presentation in
§2.31). §5.26 presents verb adjuncts: certain complement—like structures that occur with intransitive
verbs. The final sections of the chapter are devoted to: maging constructions (5.27), intensive
constructions (5.28), possessive and existential verbal constructions (5.29), and imperative, hortative, and
optative constructions (5.30).

§5.2. Survey of Major Affixes.

A major affix is an affix that combines with a verb base in the basic form of a major verb: i.e., a verb
whose inflected forms may occur in the predicate of a basic sentence. All major affixes are capable of
forming major transitive verbs, and many are capable of forming major intransitive verbs as well. In the case
of the transitive verbs, some major affixes are characteristically associated with actor—focus (AF) verbs,
others with object—focus (OF) verbs, and others with directional—focus (DF) verbs. (There is at least one
affix, ma- that occurs in both AF and OF major transitive verbs, and there are at least three, -an, -in, and
pag:...-an, that occur in both OF and DF major transitive verbs.) Most major intransitive verbs may
conveniently be considered AF. (Many such verbs are, however, essentially non—actional in character, so
that the identification of the verbs as AF is problematic — cf. §2.9. There is also a set of intransitive verbs,
the pseudo-transtives that are clearly not AF. These verbs occur with actor adjuncts, structures that
resemble actor complements in form and meaning, but that, unlike actor complements, do not correspond
to the topic of a related AF verb formed with the same base — cf. § §5.6 and 5.26.)

The major affixes are presented below in alphabetical order. (Note that & is the third letter of the
Tagalog alphabet.) Each presentation includes information about the focus of the major verbs formed with
the affix, and examples of such verbs. In some cases, further information is given about the types of
meanings associated with formations that involve the affix, the pronunciation of the formations, their
relation to formations involving other affixes, etc.

(1) -an

The suffix -an (/an/) forms transitive OF and DF verbs, and intransitive verbs. OF -an verbs typically

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 285

denote actions affecting the surface or appearance of the goal, but not causing a change in its
structure: e.g.,

buksan ‘open’
hugasan ‘wash’
sarhan ‘close’
talupan ‘peel’
walisan ‘sweep’

Many DF -an verbs denote movement in relation to a goal: ¢.g.,

abutan ‘pass (something) to”
dalhan ‘take/bring (something) to”
lapitan ‘approach’

puntahan “go to’

upuan/upan ‘sit (down) on’

Others denote actions typically involving a human goal: e.g.,

halikan ‘kiss’
ngitian ‘smile at”
tulungan ‘help’

Most of the intransitive -an verbs are pseudo—transitives. Examples of such verbs are:

ayusan ‘arrange’
bagalan ‘make slow’
hayaan ‘let’
tandaan ‘remember’

An example of an intransitive -ar verb that is not a pseudo—transitive is:
kilabutan ‘have gooseflesh, be terrified’

As is noted in §1.12, the addition of the verbal suffix -an to a verb base with a long penultimate
vowel normally effects a length shift in the base: a shortening of the originally long vowel and a
simultaneous lengthening of the final base vowel. Thus:

lapit /la*pit/ > lapitan /lapi-tan/
hugas /hu-gas/ > hugasan /huga’san/

(There is, however, no length shift in those few cases where a long penultimate base vowel is followed by a
consonant in the same syllable. Thus:

benda /be‘ndahf > bendahan /be‘ndahan/ ‘bandage’
mando /ma‘ndoh/ > manduhan /ma‘nduhan/ ‘give an order to’)

When the original long vowel is /i-/, /a*/, or /u-/, length shift in some cases involves a change of quality in
the lengthened vowel: viz., short /e/ changes to long /i-/ and short /o/ to long /u-/. Thus:

tiket /tiket/ > tikitan /tiki-tan/ ‘give a ticket to’
Abot /’a°bot/ > abutan /’abu-tan/

Elements sous droits d'auteur
When the original long vowel is /e:/ or fo:/ there is no change of quality. Thus:

abono /‘abo‘noh/ > abonohan /"abono’han/ ‘make a partial payment on’
kolorete /kolore-teh/ - koloretehan /kolorete-han/ ‘apply rouge to’

The last vowel of bases that lack penultimate length is lost in a number of common -an verbs. Thus:

bili /bilih/ > bilhan /bilhan/ ‘buy (something) from’
bukas /bukasfl_ > buksan /buksan/

In cases where the last base vowel is followed by a glottal stop, both the vowel and the glottal stop may be
lost:

upo /’upo’/ > upan /‘upan/ (also: upuan /‘upu'an/)

A listing of formations that involve loss of the final base vowel, and of the final base vowel plus glottal stop,
is presented in §5.24. (It may be noted that the final base vowel is always retained when the penultimate
syllable ends in a consonant: thus, punta /puntah/ + puntahan /puntahan/.)

(The statements made above about the pronunciation of -an verbs apply equally to -in verbs ((4),
below), and in general, to all verbs, both major and derived, formed with complex affixes that include -a
or -in, The statements do not, however, necessarily apply to formations in which -an is part of a derived
base — cf. §5.18, subsection (2).)

(2) Ka-... -an

As a major affix, ka... -an ({ka,,,an/) is always the DF counterpart of AF ma- (cf. (8), below).
(Ka- . .. -an also occurs as a derived affix — cf. §5.9.) Examples are:

kagalitan ‘scold’ (DF counterpart of AF magalit)

katuwaan ‘be amused/delighted by’ (DF counterpart of AF matuwa)
kawilihan ‘enjoy’ (DF counterpart of AF mawili)

(For pronunciation, cf. (1), above.)

Ge

As a major affix, é (/'i/) forms OF verbs and a small number of pseudo—transitive intransitive verbs.
(E- is also widely used as a derived affix — cf. §§5.7, 5.8, and 5.11.) OF & verbs often denote actions
affecting the position of the goal, but not causing a change in its structure. They usually correspond to AF
mag- verbs. Examples are:

iakyat ‘bring/take up’ (OF counterpart of AF mag-akyat)
ialok ‘offer’ (OF counterpart of AF mag-alok)

isakay ‘take aboard’ (OF counterpart of AF magsakay)
itapon ‘throw’ (OF counterpart of AF magtapon)

iuwi ‘take home’ (OF counterpart of AF mag-uwi)

Examples of pseudo-transitive i- verbs are:
ihalal ‘elect?
ipalagay ‘consider’

iyuko ‘bow (the head)’

J- verbs whose bases begin with /’/ normally have two freely alternating pronunciations, one with the
base--initial /’/ retained, and one with the base-initial /’/ replaced by /y/. Thus:

akyat /‘akyat/ > iakyat /*i’akyat/~/'iyakyat/
uwi /‘uwi’/ > iuwi /'Puwi'/~/‘iyuwi']

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 287

(4) -in .
The suffix -in (fin) forms transitive OF and DF verbs, and a smaller number of intransitive verbs. OF

-in verbs typically denote actions radically affecting the goal, such as those causing a change in its structure.
Examples are:

gawin ‘make, do’
inumin ‘drink*
lutuin ‘cook’
tapusin ‘finish’
tadtarin ‘chop’

DF -in verbs may denote motion in relation to a goal (in which case there is usually some element of
contact with the goal): e.g.,

panhikin ‘go up into’

pasukin ‘enter’

pukulin ‘throw (something) at’
salpukin ‘strike against”

They may also denote actions typically involving a human goal: ¢.g.,

dalawin ‘visit®
ibigin ‘love’
sundin ‘obey’

Some examples of intransitive -i verbs are:

antukin ‘be sleepy’
araw-arawin ‘perform every day’
ginawin ‘feel cold’

langgamin ‘be infested with ants’
tanawin ‘view as”

(Araw-arawin and tanawin are examples of pseudo—transitive -in verbs.)
(For pronunciation, see (1), above.)

(5) ipa-

As a major affix, ipa- (/ipa/) occurs in the OF counterpart of at least one AF ma- verb (cf. (8),
below):

ipaligo ‘bathe with’ (OF counterpast of AF maligo)

(For the use of ipa- as a derived affix, cf. §5.12.)

(6) ipag-

As a major affix, pag- (/"ipag/) occurs in the OF counterparts of a few AF mmag- verbs (cf. (11),
below). (/pag- is, however, a productive affix in the formation of derived verbs related to mag- verbs — cf.
§§5.7 and 5.8.) Examples of major ipag- verbs are:

ipagbili ‘sell’ (OF counterpart of AF magbili)
ipagkatiwala ‘entrust with’ (OF counterpart of AF magkatiwala)
ipagtapat ‘confess’ (OF counterpart of AF magtapat)
(7) ipang-
As a major affix, jpang- occurs in the OF counterparts of a few AF mang- verbs (cf. (12), below).

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
288 CHAPTER 5

(Ipang- is, however, a productive affix in the formation of derived verbs related to mang- verbs — cf. § §5.7
and 5.8.) Examples of major ipang- verbs are:

ipanganak ‘give birth to’ (OF counterpart of AF manganak)
ipangako ‘promise’ (OF counterpart of AF mangako)

(For rules governing the pronunciation of ipang- verbs, cf. the discussion of mang- verbs under (12), below.)
(8) ma-
Ma- forms transitive AF and OF major verbs, and intransitive verbs. Most transitive AF ma- verbs are
the AF counterparts of DF ka-. . . -an verbs (cf. (2), above). Examples are:

magulat ‘be surprised at’ (AF counterpart of DF kagulatan)
mainis ‘be annoyed with’ (AF counterpart of DF kainisan)
matakot ‘be afraid of (AF counterpart of DF katakutan)

There is also at least one AF ma- verb that corresponds to an OF ipa- verb (cf. (5), above), and at least one
that corresponds to an OF ma-... -an verb (cf. (9), below), and there are a very few that correspond to OF
or DF pa-.. . -an verbs (cf. (14), below):

maligo ‘bathe with’ (AF counterpart of OF ipaligo)
matuto ‘learn’ (AF counterpart of OF matutuhan)
makinig ‘listen’ (AF counterpart of OF/DF pakinggan)

Ma- occurs as an OF affix in a very few major verbs. (It is, however, a productive affix in OF and DF
verbs derived from -in verbs — cf. §5.13.) OF ma- is the OF counterpart of AF maka- (cf. (10), below).

Examples are:

makita ‘see’ (OF counterpart of AF makakita)
mahalata ‘notice’ (OF counterpart of AF makahalata)

Examples of intransitive -ma- verbs are:

mabingi ‘become deaf
mahuli ‘catch ... doing’
mamatay ‘die’

masira ‘become damaged”

(A few intransitive ma- verbs — e.g., mahuli — are pseudo—transitives. For further discussion of intransitive
maz- verbs of ‘becoming,’ cf. §5.6, subsection D.)

As an AF affix, and in intransitive verbs other than pscudo-transitives, ma- is normally pronounced
with a short vowel: thus, /magu‘lat/, /mali-go’/, /mabinih/. In OF and pseudo-transitive verbs, and in the
AF verb matuto, ma- is usually pronounced with a long vowel: thus, /ma‘ki‘tah/, /ma‘tu‘toh/. Vowel
length in these latter cases is, however, not distinctive in the usage of most younger speakers, and
pronunciations like /maki*tah/ and /matu‘toh/ also occur (cf. the discussion of vowel length in the derived
affix ma- in §5.13).

(9) ma-... -an

Ma-...-an occurs as a major affix in a very few OF and intransitive verbs. Examples of OF
ma-...-an verbs are:

matutuhan ‘learn’ (OF counterpart of AF matuto)
maramdaman ‘feel’ (OF counterpart of AF makaramdam)

(The major OF affix ma-... -an is to be distinguished from the derived affix of similar shape (cf. §5.13). A
derived verb with ma-...-an is formed by the addition of ma- to an OF or DF -an verb. Thus, for example,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 289

mabuksan ‘be able to open, accidentally open’ is formed by the addition of ma- to buksan ‘open’. A major
ma-.. an verb cannot be similarly analyzed. Thus matutuhan cannot be formed by the addition of ma- to
*rutuhan, since the latter formation does not occur.) Examples of intransitive ma-... -an verbs are:

maanghangan ‘feel a biting taste’
malamigan ‘feel cold’

In OF major verbs, the ma of ma-...-an is usually pronounced with a long vowel: thus,
/ma*tutu‘han/, /ma‘ramdaman/. Vowel length is, however, not distinctive in the usage of most younger
speakers, and pronunciations like /matutu‘han/ and /maramdaman/ also occur (cf. the discussion of vowel
length in the derived affix ma- in §5,13). In intransitive verbs the ma- of ma-...-an has a short
vowel: thus, /ma’anhanan/, /maldmigan/. (Cf. also (1), above, for notes on the pronunciation of verbs
formed with the suffix -avr.)

(10) maka-

Maka- occurs as a major affix in a very few AF transitive and intransitive verbs. (It is, however, a
productive affix for forming derived verbs — cf. §5.13.) Examples of transitive verbs are:

makahalata ‘notice’ (AF counterpart of OF mahalata)
makaramdam ‘feel’ (AF counterpart of OF maramdaman)

Examples of intransitive verbs are:

makaraos ‘be over’
makasulit ‘pass (in an examination)’

The second vowel of maka- is commonly long in the case of some major verbs, short in the case of
others: thus, usually /maka*halata’/, /makasu'lit/. In the usage of most younger speakers, however, the
length of the second vowel of maka- is non-distinctive, and pronunciations like /makahalata’/ or
/maka‘sulit/ may also occur, with the use of the less usual pronunciation not affecting the meaning of the
verb (cf. the discussion of vowel length in the derived affix maka- in §5.13.)

(11) mag-

Mag- (/mag/) forms major transitive and intransitive AF verbs. (Mag- also forms several types of
derived AF verbs — cf. §5.16.) Mag- is frequently found in major AF verbs connoting deliberate action
and/or action involving movement of an object external to the actor. The most common OF counterpart of
mag- is i- (cf. (3), above); other OF counterparts of mag- are -an, -in, ipag-, and pag-...-an. The DF
counterparts of mag- are -an (primarily in double—object verbs), -in (exclusively in double—object verbs),
and pag-...-an (in both directional and double—object verbs). Some examples of major transitive mag-
verbs are:

magbigay ‘give’

magbili ‘sell’

maghanda ‘prepare’
magluto ‘cook’
maghiganti ‘have revenge on’

Some examples of major intransitive mag- verbs are:

mag-apoy ‘burst into flames’
magbus ‘take a bus’
magdugo ‘bleed’
magtagalog ‘speak Tagalog’
magnars “become a nurse*

(cf. (17), below, for a discussion of meaning differences between major mag- and -uim- verbs formed with
the same base.)

(12) mang-
Mang forms major transitive and intransitive AF verbs. (Mang- also, and more commonly, forms
derived AF verbs — cf. §5.16, subsection (6).) Some examples of major transitive mang- verbs are:

mangailangan ‘need’
manganak ‘give birth (to)*
mangwalta ‘deprive of money fraudulently*

Some examples of major intransitive mang- verbs are:

mangaykay ‘tremble’
mangawit ‘be tired’
mangyari ‘happen®

(cf. (17) below for a discussion of meaning differences between major mang- and -um- verbs formed with
the same base.)

In formations (major or derived) involving the verbal prefix mang-, as in those involving the
homophonous nominal prefix (cf. §3.7, subsection (12)), certain assimilatory changes occur. These changes
are summarized in the following formulas:

(a) Ip/
ert {mf
It}
mang- + Iie) > {maf + Inf
Inf
ikf
et Inf
(b) (1) mang- + fo} > {maj + imf
(2) mang- + fo] > /mam/ + fof
(c) (1) mang- + ll > {maf + fal
(2) mang: + {tl > {man/ + Mi
jd} {d}
(ad) mang: + > {man/ +
i fy

The operation of these formulas is illustrated below. (The illustrations include derived as well as major
mang- verbs. Some bases that begin with /b/ form mang- verbs according to formula (b.1), others according
to formula (b.2). Similarly, some bases that begin with /*/ form mang- verbs according to formula (c.1),
others according to formula (¢.2). In several cases, the base of the mang- verb occurs only in mang- verbs
and related formations. In these cases, the base is listed with a preceding hyphen.)

(a) mang: + pili /pili*/
mang: + -manhid /manhid/
mang: + takot /ta’kot/
mang- + sakit /sakit/
mang- + -nood /nu’od/
mang- + kailangan /ka’ila‘nan/
mang: + ngaykay /naykay/

mamili /mamili’/ ‘choose (several things)’
mamanhid /mamanhid/ ‘get numb’

manakot /mana‘kot/ ‘frighten (several people)’
manakit /manakit/ ‘cause pain’

(c) (1) mang: + anak /"anak/ > manganak /mananak/ ‘give birth (to)’
(2) mang: + atake /‘ata*keh/ > mang-atake {man ‘ata*keh/ ‘attack’
(da) mang- + dukot /dukot/ > mandukot /mandukot/ ‘steal’

mang- + higaw /litgaw/ manligaw /manli-gaw/ ‘pay court to”

When the base begins with /g/, /h/, /w/, or /y/, no assimilatory changes occur. Thus:

mang: + gulo /guloh/
mang- + hiwa /hi*wa’/
mang- + walis /walis/
mang: + yari /ya‘rih/

manggulo /manguloh/ ‘create disorder’

manghiwa /manhi'wa’/ ‘cut (someone intentionally)’
mangwalis /manwalis/ ‘hit with a broom’
/manya‘tih/ ‘happen’

ese

(The assimilatory changes discussed above apply in the case of most major and derived verb formations that
include prefixes ending in ng: e.g., pang-...-an, pang-...-in, makapang-, and makipang-. In the case of
ipang- formations, however, the changes apply in some instances but not in others. Specifically, the changes
apply in the case of object—focus, benefactive—focus, and causative—focus ipang- formations (cf. (7),
above, and §§5.7 and 5.8), but not in the case of reservational—focus and instrumental—focus fpang-
formations. As is noted in §5.11, the ipang- of reservational—focus and instrumental—focus formations
consists of the verbal prefix # plus the adjectival prefix pang-. While formations involving this adjectival
prefix show certain assimilatory changes, the changes are not identical with those that occur in mang-
formations.)

(13) pa-...-an

As a major affix, pa-...-an({pa....an/) occurs in the OF or DF counterparts of a very few AF ma-
verbs (cf. (8), above). Examples are:

pakialaman ‘meddle with’ (DF counterpart of AF makialam)
pakinggan ‘listen’ (OF/DF counterpart of AF makinig)

(For a presentation of the use of pa-.. . -av in derived verb formations, cf. §5.12.)

(14) pag-...-an
Pag-...-an (/pag ...an/) occurs in OF and, more commonly, DF major verbs that correspond to AF

mag- verbs. Examples of OF pag-. . . -an verbs are:

pag-aralan ‘study’ (OF counterpart of AF mag-aral)
pagtiisan ‘endure’ (OF counterpart of AF magtiis)

Examples of DF pag-. . . -an verbs are:

pagbatayan ‘base (a decision) on’ (DF counterpart of AF magbatay)
pegabilhan ‘sell (to)’ (DF counterpart of AF magbili)
paghigantihan ‘take revenge on’ (DF counterpart of AF maghiganti)

(For pronunciation, cf. (1), above. For a discussion of the use of pag-.. . -an as a derived affix, cf. §5.9.)
(15) pang-...-an
As a major affix, pang-...-an occurs in a small number of DF and intransitive verbs. The DF verbs
correspond to AF mang- verbs. Examples are:

pangakuan ‘give a promise to’ (DF counterpart of AF mangako)
panghimasukan ‘meddle in’ (DF counterpart of AF manghimasok)

292 CHAPTER 5

Examples of intransitive verbs (all of which are adjunctive — cf. §5.6, class H1, and §5.26, subsection
I1.A.6) are:

panghinaan “feel a weakness in’
panginigan ‘have a tremor in’

(For pronunciation, cf. (1) and (12), above. For a discussion of the use of pang: ... -ait as a derived affix,
cf. §5.9.)

(16) pang-...-in
Pang-.. . -in occurs in the OF counterpart of at least one mang- verb:

panoorin ‘watch’ (OF counterpart of AF manood)

(For an explanation of the assimilatory changes that produce panoorin /panu'urin{ from
pang- + -nood + -in, cf. (12), above, and § 1.20.)

(17) -um-

The infix -unt, which is always a major affix, forms major transitive and intransitive AF verbs. It is
frequently found in verbs denoting casual action and/or action not involving movement of an object
external to the actor. The most common OF counterpart of -uim- is -in (cf. (4), above); other OF
counterparts of -m- are -an and (very rarcly) -. The DF counterparts of -unt- are -an (in both directional
and double—object verbs) and -in (exclusively in directional verbs). Some examples of major transitive -um-
verbs are:

kumain ‘eat’
humiram ‘borrow’
pumunta ‘go°
umabot ‘reach for?
umibig ‘love’

Some examples of major intransitive -ur- verbs are:

bumuti “become good”
dumating ‘arrive’
dumugo ‘bleed’
humina “become weak’
pumasa—Maynila ‘go to Manila’

(For further discussion of -um- verbs of ‘becoming,’ cf. §5.6, class J.)

(It may be noted that -wnt does not occur with bases beginning with /m/ or /w/.)

There are many verb bases that occur with mag- or mang- as well as with -m-. Some of these mag-
and mang- verbs are best considered as derived from the -wm- verb formed with the same base, while others
are best considered as independent major verbs. Characteristic meaning differences that distinguish derived
mag- or mang- verbs from the major -um- verbs that underlie them are presented in §5.16.

Characteristic meaning differences that distinguish major mag- or mang- verbs from major -ua- verbs
formed with the same base are discussed immediately below.

In many cases, major transitive -um- and mag. verbs formed with the same base belong to different
complement classes, the -unt verb being directional, the ag- verb object or double—object. In these cases,
the -um- verb generally designates a movement from one place to another on the part of the performer, the
mag- verb a movement from one place to another of some object external to the performer. Examples are:

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 293

-um- Verb Mag: Verb

lumabas *come/go out’ maglabas ‘bring/take out’
pumasok ‘enter’ magpasok ‘bring/take in”
umakyat ‘climb’ mag-akyat ‘bring/take up”
umalis ‘leave, go away” mag-alis ‘remove’

umuwi ‘go home’ mag-uwi ‘bring/take home’

There are also a good many cascs of directional -wim- verbs that are formed with the same base as
intransitive mag- verbs. In these cases, the mag- verb generally designates a reciprocal performance of the
actional designated by the -tam- verb. Examples are:

-um- Verb Mag- Verb

humiwalay ‘separate from’ maghiwalay ‘separate from one another’
lumaban ‘fight with’ maglaban ‘fight with one another’
sumalubong ‘meet (someone)’ magsalubong ‘meet one another’

In a few cases, there is a correspondence between an -um- verb that expresses an action directed or
oriented toward the performer and a mag- verb formed with the same base that expresses an action directed
or oriented away from the performer. Examples are:

-um- Verb Mag- Verb
bumili ‘buy’ magbili ‘sell”
umabot ‘reach for’ mag-abot ‘hand to”

(The pair umabot/mag-abot also involves a contrast between a directional -wyt- verb and a double—object
mag- verb — see above.)

The major mang- verbs that are formed with the same base as -um- verbs are intransitive. The -um-
verbs are also intransitive, and designate the (complete or permanent) acquisition of a quality, while the
mang- verbs designate the partial or temporary acquisition of this same quality. Examples are:

-um- Verb Mang- Verb
kumupas “become colorless’ mangapas ‘fade’
lumaki ‘grow, enlarge’ manlaki ‘enlarge temporarily’ (used, e.g.,
of the eyes in an expression of surprise)
pumula ‘become red’ mamula ‘become reddish, redden temporarily”

§5.3. Affix—correspondence classes: object verbs.

As is specified in §2.12, an AFFIX-CORRESPONDENCE CLASS is a class to which a verb base is
assigned by virtue of its co-occurrence with an affix set: a set of two or more major affixes which, together
with the base, form major transitive verbs of differing focus but otherwise identical meaning. Bases of verbs
belonging to the object—verb complement class (cf. §2.10) co-occur with an affix set that consists of an
actor—focus (AF) affix and an object—focus (OF) affix; bases of verbs belonging to the directional—verb
complement class co-occur with an affix set that consists of an AF affix and a directional—focus (DF) affix;

and bases of verbs belonging to the double—object—verb complement class co-occur with an affix set that
consists of an AF affix, an OF affix, and a DF affix. The various affix-correspondence classes of

object—verb bases are presented in this section, those of directional—verb bases and double-object-verb
bases in § $5.4, and 5.5 respectively. The presentation of the classes of object—verb bases is preceded,
immediately below, by some notes on the criteria by which a base is assigned to its particular
affix~ correspondence class(es). These notes cover: (1) the treatment of bases that occur in two or more
verbs of identical focus formed with different major affixes;(2) the treatment of bases that co-occur with
the members of a single affix sct to form major verbs that belong to two different complement classes.

(1) A focus is never represented more than once in a given affix set. Thus an affix set may include
only one AF affix and one OF and/or DF affix. There are, however, many bases that co-occur with two or

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
294 CHAPTER 5

more major affixes to form verbs of identical focus. Cases of this kind are treated in one of four ways, as
follows:

(a) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have clearly different
meanings, the base is assigned to two different affix—correspondence classes. The base abot, for example,
forms an AF verb meaning ‘reach for’ with -uwm-, and an AF verb meaning ‘hand to’ with mag-. Since the
members of an affix set occur, by definition, only in verbs of identical meaning, umabot and mag-abot do
not belong to the same affix set, and the base abor must be assigned to two different classes. (The classes
are, in this case, the -um-/-in object—verb class (umabot/abutin ‘reach for’ — cf. class E.2a, below) and the
mag-/i-J-an double—object—verb class (mag-abot fiabot fabutan ‘hand to’ — cf. §5.5, class A.1).)

(b) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have similar but slightly
different meanings, and both meanings are expressed in a single verb of another focus formed with the same
base, the base is assigned to two affix—correspondence classes that have an affix in common. Thus the base
slat forms, with & and -in, OF verbs both of which have the meaning ‘write.’ The -in verb, however,
connotes creative writing while the # verb connotes primarily writing of other kinds: e.g., the writing of
letters. The AF verb susulat corresponds in meaning to both the -in verb and the & verb, and may or may
not connote creative writing. Sulat is therefore assigned to two affix—correspondence classes, in both of
which -um- occurs: the -wm-/-in object—verb class (smulat/sulatin ‘write (creatively)’) and the -um-/i-/-an
double—object—verb class (sumulat/isulat/sulaton ‘write, write to, write on’ — cf. §5.5, class C.1).)

(c) Where two transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have similar but slightly
different meanings, and only one of these meanings is found in a verb (or verbs) of different focus formed
with the same base, only the verb with the exact semantic counterpart(s) is considered a major verb, and
the other verb is interpreted as derived. Thus the base Auha forms, with -um- and mang-, AF verbs both of
which mean ‘get.’ The mang- verb, however, has the additional meaning of activity directed toward multiple
objects, and there is no goal—focus verb formed with kuwha that has this additional meaning. Therefore the
-um- verb is considered primary for purposes of assignment of the base to an affix—correspondence
class — in this case, the -um-/-in/-an double—object—verb class (Kumuha/kunin{kunan ‘get’)— and the
mang- verb (manguha ‘get (a number of items), gather’) is interpreted as a derived verb (cf. §5.16,
subsection (6)).

(d) Where two major transitive verbs of identical focus and a common base have identical meanings,
the base is always assigned to two affix—correspondence classes. For example, the base fluro forms, with /-
and -in, freely alternating OF verbs meaning ‘cook’; both OF verbs correspond to AF magluto, and luto is
thus assigned to both the mag-/i- object—verb class (rnagluto/iluto ‘cook’ — cf. class C.2, below) and the
mag-/-in object—verb class (magluto/lutuin ‘cook’ — cf. class C.3, below).

(2) There are a number of affix sets that may be associated with either object verbs or directional
verbs. Thus the members of the -um-/-an affix set occurs both in object verbs (e.g., lumunas/lunasan
‘cure’ — cf. class E.1, below) and in directional verbs (e.g., dusmalo/daluhan ‘attend’ — cf. §5.4, class D.1).
In most cases, a given base occurs with the members of such an affix set in cither object or directional verbs
but not in both. (Thus the base funas occurs in the -um-/-an object—verb class but not the -um-/-an
directional—verb class, while the base dalo occurs in the directional—verb but not the object—verb class.)
There are, however, certain bases that co-occur with the members of a single affix set to form both object
and directional verbs. (That is, the AF verbs formed with the bases may take cither an object complement
or a directional complement.) Such bases are always assigned to both the object—verb class and the
directional—verb class identified with the given affix set.

In some cases the object and directional verbs formed with a common base and a common affix set
differ from one another in meaning. For example, the base hawak occurs in both the -wn-/-an object—verb
class and the -urn-/-an directional—verb class, the object verbs having the meaning ‘hold,’ as in:

Humawak siya ng libro.
‘He held a book,’

Hinawakan niya ang libro.
‘He held the book.”

and the directional verbs having the meaning ‘hold on to,” as in:

Eldmante cane droite Atautanur

SC SS SSS
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 295

{Tisseks siya sa barandilya.

Hinawakan niya ang barandilya.
‘He held on to the railing.”

In other cases, the object and directional verbs formed with a common base and a common affix set are
identical in meaning. For example, the base Ainig occurs in both the ma-/pa-. . . -an object—verb class and
the ma-/pa-...-an ditectional—verb class in verbs that mean ‘listen to.’ Examples of the AF verbs in
sentences are:

Nakinig kami ng talumpati.
‘We listened to a speech.”

Nakinig kami sa talumpati.
‘We listened to the speech.”

The first sentence involves the object verb makinig, the second the homophonous directional verb. The
goal—focus counterpart of both sentences is:

Pinakinggan namin ang talumpati.
“We listened to the speech.’

in which pinakinggan (the perfective form of pakinggan) is ambiguously either object—focus or
directional—focus.

Regardless, then, of whether the object verbs and the directional verbs formed with a common base
and a common affix set are the same or different in meaning, the base is always classified as both an
object—verb base and a directional—verb base.

In the following presentation, the affix—correspondence classes of object—verb bases are presented in
alphabetical order, according, first, to the AF affixes, then to the OF affixes, that occur in the affix sets.
(In the notation used to identify an affix set, the AF affix precedes the OF affix, and the two are separated
by a slash.) Examples of bases that occur in each class are followed by a parenthetic listing of the pertinent
basic forms and a translation of the latter. (Wherever possible, four bases are listed for each class. If fewer
than four bases are listed, the class is an unproductive one, and the listed examples may be the only ones
that occur. Bases that never occur word—initially are listed with a preceding hyphen.) The examples of
bases and basic forms are followed by a set of sentences illustrating the affix correspondences. Only one set
of verbs in each class is chosen for these illustrative sentences. The examples and illustrative sentences are in
some cases accompanied by remarks of various kinds.

A. Ma- classes (very few bases in each class)

1. ma-/ipa-
-ligo (maligo/ipaligo ‘bathe with’)
AF: Naligo siya ng mainit na tubig.
‘He bathed with hot water.

OF: = Ipinaligo niya ang mainit na tubig.
‘He bathed with the hot water.’

2. ma-/ma-...-an

The base -kinig also occurs in the directional—verb ma-/pa- . . . -art class (cf. §5.4, class A.3).

B. Maka- classes (very few bases in each class)

1. maka-/ma-
kita (makakita/makita ‘see’)
dinig (makarinig/marinig ‘hear’)

2a. maka-(nom)/ma- .. . -an

The maka- verbs in this class occur only in nominalized verbals: i.e., after one of the markers ang,

ng, sa (cf. §3.24). Examples are:

limot (makalimot/ma(ka)limutan ‘forget’)

tanda (makatand/matandaan ‘remember’)

AF: Siya ang nakalimot ng libro niya.
‘He's the one who forgot his book.”

2. mag: /i-
kula (magkula/ikula ‘bleach (in the sun)")

pinid (magpinid/ipinid ‘close’)
AF: Magkukula sila ng mga damit.
‘They're going to bleach some clothes.’

OF: Ikukula nila ang mga damit.
‘They're going to bleach the clothes.”

Most mag- verbs denoting ways of preparing food have two object—focus counterparts, one
formed with é-, the other with -in. The i- and -in verbs are normally free alternants. Examples
are: iluto ~ lutuin ‘cook’; ipaksiw ~ paksiwin ‘make into paksiw; iprito ~ prituhin ‘fry.’ The
bases of such verbs are assigned to two object—verb classes: the mag-/i- class and the mag-/-in class
(class C.3, below).

3. mag-f-in
kudkod (magkudkod/kudkurin ‘grate (coconut)’)
hiwa (maghiwa/fhiwain ‘cut’)
luto (magluto/lutuin ‘cook’)
plantsa (magplantsa/plantsahin ‘iron’)
AF: Magkudkod ka ng niyog.
‘Grate some coconut.’

OF: Kudkurin mo ang niyog.
‘Grate the coconut.’

Many mag-/-in object—verb bases — e.g., kudkod, hiwa, plantsa -- also occur in the -um/-in or
-um(nom)/-in object—verb class (respectively, class E.2a and class E.2b, below), the -wom- and mag-
verbs having similar or identical meanings. For further discussion, cf. E.2b, below.

For a note on the alternation between é and -i with bases denoting ways of preparing food, cf.
C,2 above.

tiis (magtiis/pagtiisan ‘endure’)

AF: Nagtiis siya ng kahirapan.
‘He endured some hardship.’

OF: Pinagtiisan niya ang kahirapan.
‘He endured the hardship.”

Tiis also occurs in the mag-/-in object—verb class — class C.3, above; tiisin and pagtiisan are free
or dialectal alternants.

kailangan (mangailangan/kailanganin ‘need’)
AF: Nangangailangan kami ng tulong ninyo.
‘We need (some of) your help.)

OF: Kinakailangan namin ang tulong ninyo.
‘We need your help.”

Some speakers use Kumailangan instead of, or in alternation with, snangailangan. For these
speakers, kailangan belongs to the -wm-/-in object—verb class (class E.2a, below) instead of, or in
addition to, the mang-/-in object—verb class.

3. mang. fipang-
anak (manganak/ipanganak ‘give birth to’)

lunas (lumunas/lunasan ‘cure’)
tangan (tumangan/tang(a)nan ‘hold’)
tikim (tumikim/tikman ‘taste’)
AF: Humawak siya ng libro,
‘He held a book.”
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 299

OF: Hinawakan niya ang libro.
‘He held the book.”

Hawak and tangan also occur in the directional—verb -um-/-an class (§5.4, class D.t). The
directional verbs have the meaning ‘hold on to.”

2a. -um-/-in
abot (umabot/abutin ‘reach for’)
huli (humuli/hulihin catch’)
tahi (tumahi/tahiin ‘sew’)
tugtog (tumugtog/tugtugin ‘play (an instrument)’)
AF: Umabot ka ng mangga.
‘Reach for a mango."

OF: Abutin mo ang mangga.
‘Reach for the mango.”

Abot also occurs in the mag-/i-/an double—object—verb class (§5.5, class A.1). The
double— object verbs have the meaning ‘hand to."

2b. uen-(nom)/-in
The -tam- verbs in this class occur only in nominalized verbals: i.e., after one of the markers
ang, ng, sa (cf. §3.24). Examples are:

basag (bumasag/basagin ‘break’)
kudkod (kumudkod/kudkurin ‘grate (coconut)’)
gulat (gumulat/gulatin ‘surprise’)
takot (tumakot/takutin ‘frighten’)
AF: Ako ang bumasag ng baso.
‘I'm the one who broke a glass.’

OF: Binasag ko ang baso.
‘I broke the glass.

Bases in this class are divisible into two subclasses: (1) those that form -wmn-(nom)/-in verbs
that require animate objects: ¢.g., gulat, takot; and (2) those that form -wm-(nom)/-in verbs that
denote ways of fragmenting or disintegrating an object: e.g., basag, kudkod. Most bases in subclass
(1) also occur in derived mang- verbs denoting actions directed toward multiple objects (cf. §5.16,
subsection (6)). The mang- verbs, unlike the -ur- verbs from which they are derived, need not be
nominalized, Thus:

Nanggulat siya ng mga kaibigan niya.
‘He surprised (some of) his friends.”

but not:

*Gumulat siya ng mga kaibigan niya.
(cf. Siya ang gumulat ng mga kaibigan niya,
*He’s the one who surprised (some of) his friends.’)

Some other bases in this subclass are: bigo (bumigofbiguin ‘disappoint’), gutom
(gumutom/gutumin ‘starve’), hiya (humiya/hiyain ‘ernbarrass’). (At least one base in subclass (1),
Patay (pumatay/patayin ‘kill’), does not occur in a derived smang- verb. Patay does, however, also
occur in the mag-/-in object—verb class (class C.3, above) in formations which differ somewhat in
CHAPTER 5
use from those representing the -wm-(nom)/-in class. The -u-(nom)-in formations are used with
human objects, the mag-/-in formations with non-human objects. Thus:

Siya ang pumatay ng sundalo.
“He’s the one who killed a soldier.’

Nagpatay siya ng lamok.
‘He killed a mosquito.”

{ sundalo,
Pinatay niya ang
| lamok,
soldier.”
‘He killed the
mosquito.”

Most -w7-(nom)j-in bases in subclass (2) also occur in the mag-/-in object—verb class (class C.3,
above). The mag- verbs, unlike the -wn- verbs, need not be nominalized. Thus:

Nagbasag ako ng baso.
‘I broke a glass.’

Other bases in this subclass include: durog (dumurog/durugin ‘pulverize’), giling (gumiling/gilingin
‘grind’), sunog (sumunog/sunugin ‘burn’).

Certain bases in subclass (2) also occur in -unt-/-in verbs that do not require nominalization (as
well as in mag-/in verbs). The -uen-/-in verbs (which belong to class E.2a, above) differ somewhat
in meaning from the -um-(nom)/-in verbs (and miag-/-in verbs) formed with the same base, and
denote the obtaining of part of an object by means of fragmenting it. Thus, for example, the
-um-/-in verb formed with the base Aiwa has the meaning ‘slice off:

Humiwa ka niyon,
‘Slice (some of) that off.’

Hiwain mo iyon,
‘Slice that off.’

while the -wn(nom)/-in verb (as well as the mag-/-in verb) formed with the same base has the
meaning ‘slice’:

Ikaw ang humiwa noon.
“You slice (some of) that.’

Hiwain mo iyon.
‘Slice that.’

(In the case of the verbs under discussion, only a non-nominalized -wim- verb unambiguously
expresses the meaning of obtaining by fragmenting. An -in verb, as the examples show, may have
cither this meaning or simply the meaning of fragmenting, while a nominalized -um- verb is also
ambiguous, since it may represent either the -wm-(nom)/-in class or a nominalization of the -wmn-
verb in the -wm-/-in class. Thus /kaw ang humiwa noon may also mean ‘You slice (some of) that
off.") Some other bases that behave like Aiwa are: bali (bumali/baliin ‘break (off)’), gupit
(gumupit/gupitin ‘cut (off) (with scissors)'), putol (pumutol/putulin ‘cut (off)'), taga
(tumagaftagain ‘cut (off) (with a knife)').

§5.4. Affix—correspondence classes: directional verbs.

The following presentation of the affix—correspondence classes identified with directional verbs
parallels the presentation of the classes of object—verb bases in §5.3, except that the second affix listed in
each affix set is a DF, rather than an OF, affix.

A. Ma- classes

1. ma-/-an
higa (mahiga/higaan ‘lie on‘)
tulog (matulog/tulugan ‘sleep in/on’)
upo (maupo/upuan ‘sit on’)
AF: Nahiga siya sa sahig.
DF: Hinigaan niya ang sahig.
‘He lay on the floor.”

Higa and upo occur in the -um-/-an directional—verb class (class D.1, below) as well as in the
ma-j-an directional—verb class. In some dialects ~ but not in educated Manila Tagalog — nulog also
occurs in the -um-/-an directional—verb class. (In derived formations, all three bases function as if
they formed major AF verbs exclusively with -um-. Thus the aspectless gerunds formed with the bases
(cf. §3.26) are paghiga, pagtulog, and pag-upo, forms that follow the pattern for -um- verb bases
(pag- + base) rather than that for ma- verb bases (pagka- + base).)

2. ma-/ka-...-an
hirati (mahirati/kahiratihan ‘get used to’)
muhi (mamuhi/kamuhian ‘hate’)
suya (masuya/kasuyaan ‘be surfeited with’)
takot (matakot/katakutan ‘be afraid of")
{Ar Nahihirati ako sa klima. \
DF: Kinahihiratian ko ang klima.
‘I'm getting used to the climate.”

3. ma-/pa-...-an
-kialam (makialam/pakialaman ‘meddle with’)
-kibagay (makibagay/pakibagayan ‘adapt oneself to’)
-kinig (makinig/pakinggan ‘listen to’)
-kisama (makisama/pakisamahan ‘get along with,” ‘live with’)
{nr Nakikialam siyang palagi sa tenia
DF: Pinakikialaman niya silang palagi.
‘He is always meddling with them.’

It may be noted that the bases in this class all begin with ki-. This ki- is probably related
historically to the prefix component ki- that occurs in social verbs (cf. §5.14), but it is most
conveniently treated as part of the base in the case of the verbs under discussion. The elements
that follow the ki- of -kialam- -kibagay and -kisama also occur independently:alam ‘something
known,’ bagay ‘suitable’ sama ‘company.’ The element that follows the ki- of -kinig does not occur
independently, but is perhaps a contracted form of dinig, the base of the object verb

makarinig/marinig ‘hear’ (cf. §5.3, class B.1). (-kinig also occurs in the ma-/pa- . . . -an object—verb
class — cf’. §5,3, class A.3.)

B. Mag- classes
1. mag-f-an
bayad (magbayad/bayaran ‘make a payment to’)
maktol (magmaktol/maktulan ‘behave sulkily towards’)
masid (magmasid/masdan ‘look at’)
matyag (magmatyag/matyagan ‘observe cautiously’)
AF: Nagbayad siya sa bangko,
1DE: Binayaran niya ang bangko.f
‘He made a payment to the bank.’

CHAPTER 5

It may be noted that most of the bases in this class begin with /m/, a phoneme that never
occurs as the initial consonant of the base of an -w- verb (cf. §5.2, subsection (17)). This fact is
probably relevant to the occurrence of these bases in the mag-/-an directional—verb class, rather
than in the much larger -w-/-an directional—verb class (class D.1, below).

The base bayad also occurs in the mag-/i-/-an double—object—verb class in the meaning ‘pay in
the form of and in the mag/-an object—verb class in the meaning ‘pay for’.

Maktol and masid also occur in the mag-/pag-.. . -an directional—verb class (class B.2, below).

2. mag-/pag-...-an
hati (maghati/paghatian ‘share’)
higanti (maghiganti/paghigantihan ‘have revenge on’)
mataas (magmataas/pagmataasan ‘be snobbish toward’)
sawa (magsawa/pagsawaan ‘be tired of)
{nr Naghati sila sa keyk. }
DF: Pinaghatian nila ang keyk.
‘They shared the cake.”

A number of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3) occur as bases of mag-/pag-. . . -an directional verbs that
express a meaning of assuming, or pretending to possess, the quality denoted by the adjective.
Compare: mataas ‘high,’ magmataas/pagmataasan ‘be snobbish toward (i.e., pretend to be higher
than)’; mabait ‘kind,’ magmabait/pagmabaitan ‘pretend to be kind to.’ (There are also ma-

adjectives that occur as bases of intransitive mag- verbs expressing similar meanings — cf. §5.6,
class G.)

C. Mang- classes (very few bases in each class)
1. mang-/-in
-pupo (mamupo/pupuin ‘use po (respect particle) in addressing’)
panginoon (mamanginoon/panginoonin ‘serve’)
{Af Namumupo siya sa akin.
DF: Pinupupo niya ako.
‘He uses po in addressing me.”

2. mang: /ma-
talo (manalo/matalo ‘win against’)
AF: Nanalo ako kay Juan.
DF: Natalo ko si Juan.
‘I won against Juan.”

3. mang-/pang- ...-an
himasok (manghimasok/panghimasukan ‘meddle in’)
hinayang (manghinayang/panghinayangan ‘regret the loss of*)
pitagan (mamitagan/pamitaganan ‘respect’)
AF: Nanghimasok sila sa gawain namin. \
DF: Pinanghimasukan nila ang gawain namin.
‘They meddled in our affairs.”

D. -wm- classes
1. -um-/-an
dalo (dumalo/daluhan ‘attend’)
hawak (humawak/hawakan ‘hold on to’)
punta (pumunta/puntahan ‘go to’)
tulong (tumulong/tulungan ‘help’)
{or Dadalo ka ba sa pulong?
DF: Dadaluhan mo ba ang Stent
‘Will you attend the meeting?”

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 303

Hawak also occurs in the -um-/-an object—verb class (cf. §5.3, class E.1). The object—verb
formations have the meaning ‘hold.”

2. -um-f-in
akyat (umakyat/akyatin ‘climb’)
pasok (pumasok/pasukin ‘enter’)
salungat (sumalungat/salungatin ‘opposc’)
sunod (sumunod/sundin ‘follow’)
ee Umakyat siya sa punong-mangga. \
OF: Inakyat niya ang punong-mangga.
‘He climbed the mango tree.” |

Akyat and pasok, like a number of other bases in the -um-/-in directional—verb class, also occur
as bases of mag-/i-/-an double—object verbs (cf. §5.5, class A.1). The directional verbs express
some movement of the actor from one place to another, while the double—object verbs express
some movement of an object external to the actor from one place to another.
Compare:umakyat/akyatin ‘climb,’ mag-akyat/iakyat/akyatan “bring/take up to’:pumasok /pasukin
‘enter,’ magpasok/ipasok/pasukan ‘bring/take into’; dumabasflabasin ‘come/go outside,”
maglabas/filabas/labasan ‘bring/take outside.’

The following presentation of the affix—correspondence classes identified with double—object verb
| classes parallels the presentation of object—verb and directional—verb classes in § §5.3 and 5.4, except that
each affix set includes three affixes: an AF affix, an OF affix, and a DF affix (which are listed in that
" order).

Bili also occurs in the -um-/-in/-an double—ojbect—verb class (class B.2, below). The-win-/-in/-an
formations have the meaning ‘buy from.’

‘I wrote him aletter.’

OF: Isinulat ko sa kaniya ang liham.
‘I wrote him the letter.”

DF: Sinulatan ko siya ng liham.
“‘Ewrote him a letter.”

Sulat also occurs in the -um-/-in object—verb class (§5.3, class E.2a), in formations with the
meaning ‘write (creatively).’ The -um-/i-/-an verb has, in addition to the meaning ‘write to,’ the
meaning ‘write on, make marks on,’ as in:

{ Sumutat ako ng pangalan ko sa papel.
Isinulat ko ang pangalan ko sa papel.
Sinulatan ko ng pangalan ko ang papel.
‘I wrote my name on the paper.’

As is the case with many other AF double--object verbs, swmulat need not be followed by both an
object complement and a directional complement, but may occur with only one. Thus, also:

ng liham.
Sumulat ako
sa kaniya.
{ aletter.”
‘I wrote 4
} tohim.’

(The goal—focus counterparts of the above sentences are:

Isinulat ko ang liham.
‘I wrote the letter.”

Sinulatan Ko siya.
‘I wrote to him.’)

§5.6. Affix classes of major intransitive verbs.

Major intransitive verbs are formed with one of ten affixes, each of which defines an affix class.
Certain subclasses can be established within the affix classes on the basis of the types of sentence structures
into which the verbs enter. In the presentation below, these classes are called: SIMPLE INTRANSITIVES,
PSEUDO-TRANSITIVES, ADJUNCTIVES, and ADJUNCTIVE PSEUDO-TRANSITIVES. A simple
intransitive (hereafter, SI) verb is one that accepts no adjuncts. (An ADJUNCT is one of certain structures
that occur in a non-focus relationship to the verb, and that do not correspond to the topic of a related verb
formed with the same base. Adjuncts are presented in detail in §5.26.) A pseudo—transitive (PT) verb is
one that accepts an actor adjunct (a structure that is similar in form and meaning to the actor complement
that occurs with a GF transitive verb). An adjunctive (A) verb does not accept an actor adjunct, but accepts

an adjunct of some other type. An adjunctive pscudo—transitive (APT) verb accepts both an actor adjunct
and an adjunct of some other type.

A.-an class
bagal (bagalan ‘make slow’ PT)
kilabot (kilabutan ‘feel terrified’ SI)
gupit (gupitan ‘cut’ APT)
pawis (pawisan ‘sweat’ SI)
sakit (saktan ‘have a pain in’ A)
tamis (tamisan ‘make sweet’ PT)

Bagalan mo ang lakad mo,
‘Walk slowly.”
(Literally: ‘Make your walking slow’)

SI, PT, A and APT verbs all occur (cf. §5.26, classes 1.1, ILA.1, HILA.I, HI.B.I, and HILC.1), with PT
and APT verbs in the majority. A subclass of PT verbs is formed with bases that also occur as the
bases of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3); these verbs express the ‘making’ or ‘producing’ of the quality
expressed by the adjective. (The base pawis also occurs in pagpawisan ~ pagpusan ‘sweat,’ an
intransitive verb that alternates freely with pawisan, pagpawisan ~ pagpusan is apparently a unique
example of an intransitive pag-...-an verb, and pag-... -art is not included in the present inventory
of intransitive—verb affixes.)

B. i- class (relatively few bases)
kasal (ikasal ‘get married to’ A)
kaway (ikaway ‘wave (the hand)’ PT)
galaw (igalaw ‘move (a part of the body)* PT)
halal (halal ‘elect’ APT)

Ikinasal siya kay Maria.
“He got married to Maria.”

The intransitive verbs formed with é are all A, PT, or APT (cf. $5.26, classes (1.2, I1.B.1, and
IIL.C.2). The majority of them are PT verbs expressing the movement of some part of the body.

C. -in class (relatively few bases)
agad (agarin ‘do without delay’ PT)
antok (antukin ‘feel sleepy’ SI)
kulang (kulangin ‘be short of A)
hintay (hintayin ‘wait for... to” APT)
langgam (langgamin “be infested with ants’ SI)

Agarin mo ang kampanya.
‘Campaign without delay’

SI, PT, A and APT verbs all occur (cf. §5.26, classes 1.3, II.A.2, 1I.C.1, and III.C.3). Most nouns
that designate insects may occur as bases of SI -in verbs that express the meaning of being infested
with the specified insect. Compare: langgam ‘ant,’ langgamin ‘be infested with ants’; lamok
‘mosquito,’ lamukin ‘be infested with mosquitoes,” etc.

D. Ma: class
bingi (mabingi ‘become deaf SI)
basag (mabasag ‘get broken’ SI)
huli (mahuli ‘catch (someone doing something)’ APT)
mahal (mamahal ‘become expensive’ SI)
-matay (mamatay ‘die’ SI)
tukso (matukso ‘be tempted (to)’ A)

Nabibingi ang Lolo.
‘Grandfather is becoming deaf.’

Most of the bases that occur in this class also occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2), and the SI
verbs they form, which may be called ma- VERBS OF ‘BECOMING,’ denote the acquisition of the
quality expressed by the adjective; their usual English equivalents involve ‘become’ or ‘get’ plus an
adjective. Compare: bingi ‘deaf,’ mabingi ‘become deaf’; basag ‘broken,’ mabasag ‘get broken,’ etc.
As is noted in §4.2, some unaffixed adjectives that lack penultimate vowel length are related to
nouns that show such length: ¢.g., basag /basag/ “broken,” basag /ba:sag/ *(a) break.’ When adjectives
such as these occur as bases of ma- verbs of becoming, they are identical in form with the related
nouns, and show penultimate vowel length: e.g., mabasag /maba:sag/ ‘get broken.” (Sec also the
discussion of -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ under J, below.)

A few A and APT mma- verbs also occur (cf. §5.26, classes I1.A.3 and UI.C.2).

E. Ma-...-an

CHAPTER 5

Naanghangan siya sa sili.
‘He found the pepper biting in taste."

Most of the bases in this class also occur as the bases of mta- adjectives (cf. §4.3). The verbs have
the meaning of attributing to something the quality expressed by the adjective (in which case they are
A) and/or of experiencing the quality expressed by the adjective (in which case they are Sl).
Compare: maanghang ‘biting in taste,’ maanghangan ‘find (something) biting in taste’; »mainit ‘hot,’
mainitan ‘feel hot,” ‘find (something) hot.’ (For a presentation of the adjuncts taken by ma-...-an
verbs, cf. §5.26, classes 11.A.4, II.B.2, and II.C.3).

F. Maka- class (relatively few bases)
daan (makaraan ‘be over’ SI)
daos (makaraos ‘be over’ SI)
sulit (makasulit ‘pass (in an examination)’ A)

Nakaraan na ang pista.
‘The fiesta is over now."

The few verbs in this class are SI or A (cf. §5.26, class I1.B.3).

(Certain intransitive verbs formed with maka- may be analyzed as optional contractions of the
ability/involuntary—action forms of intransitive indirect—action verbs —cf. §§5.12 and 5.13.
Examples are: makaalat ~ makapagpaalat ‘make salty’ (literally, ‘be able to cause to become
salty’ — cf. umalat ‘become salty’), makatamis ~ makapagpatamis ‘make sweet’ (cf. tumamis ‘become
sweet’), Like other indirect—action verbs, the maka- verbs take a secondary—actor complement such
as the ng phrase in Nekatamis ng kape ang asukal ‘The sugar made the coffee sweet.")

G. Mag- class
abogado (mag-abogado ‘become a lawyer’ SI)
atubili (mag-atubili ‘hesitate to” A)
bus (magbus ‘ride a bus’ SI)
kamayan (magkamayan ‘exchange handshakes’ SI)
hiwalay (maghiwalay ‘separate from one another’ SI)
mabagal (magmabagal ‘be slow (in)’ SI or A)
madaling-araw (magmadaling-araw ‘be dawn’ SI)
-sa-Kastila (magsa-Kastila ‘be like a Spaniard’ SI)

Nag-aabogado si Juan.
‘Juan is becoming a lawyer.’

Most intransitive mag- verbs are SI; a few are A (cf. §5.26, class II.C.5).

Many of the bases that occur in this class also occur as unmarked nouns. In the case of nouns
designating a member of a profession, the verbs express the meaning of becoming a member of this
profession. Compare: abogado ‘lawyer,’ mag-abogado ‘become a lawyer’; maestro ‘teacher,’
magmaestro ‘become a teacher’; nars ‘nurse,’ magnars ‘become a nurse.” In other cases, the verb may
express the meaning of making use of the item designated by the noun in the normal or appropriate
way: ¢.g., riding, for vehicles (bus ‘bus,’ magbus ‘ride a bus’); wearing, for articles of clothing
(kurbata ‘tie,’ magkurbata ‘wear a tie’); speaking, for languages (/nggles ‘English,’ mag-Inggles ‘speak
English’); smoking, for tobacco (sigarilyo ‘cigarette,’ magsigarilyo ‘smoke (cigarettes)’), etc. Or the
verb may express the meaning of producing the item designated by the noun: e.g., asin ‘salt,’
mag-asin ‘produce salt,’ bunga ‘fruit,’ magbunga ‘bear fruit,’ etc.

There are two subclasses of intransitive mag- verbs that express reciprocal or joint actions involving
two or more actors: one formed with bases that also occur as derived nouns ending in the suffix -an
(cf. §3.7, subsection (2)), the other formed with bases that do not include the suffix -an. Some
examples of verbs in the first subclass are: magkamayan ‘exchange handshakes’ (cf. Xamayan

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 309

‘exchange of handshakes’), magsaksakan ‘stab one another’ (cf. saksakan ‘stabbing one another’),
magtakbuhan ‘ron together’ (cf. takbuhan ‘running together’). Some examples of verbs in the second
subclass are: mag-away ‘quarrel with one another’ (cf. away ‘(a) quarrel"), magsalubong ‘greet one
another’ (cf. salubong ‘greeting’). (cf. also §5.16, subsection (4), for a presentation of multiple
reciprocal verbs.)

There is also a subclass of intransitive mag- verbs formed with ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3 and §5.18,
subsection (2.b.1)) as bases. The verbs denote assuming, or pretending to possess, the quality
designated by the adjective. Compare: mabagal ‘slow,’ magmabagal ‘be slow (in), madali ‘fast,’
magmadali ‘hurry (in),’ mayaman ‘rich,’ magmayaman ‘pretend to be rich.’ (Ma- adjectives also occur
as the bases of mag-/pag- . . . -an directional verbs of similar meaning — cf. §5.3, class B.2.)

Intransitive mag- verbs with bases expressing times of day (e.g., magmadaling-araw ‘be down’ — cf.
madaling-araw ‘down’) and other natural phenomena occur in topicless phenomenal sentences (cf.
§7.21 for further examples and discussion). Intransitive mag- verbs with bases consisting of sa- plus a
noun designating a person denote the assumption of the behavior of the person or type of person
designated by the noun. Compare: Kastila ‘Spaniard,’ magsa-Kastila ‘behave like a Spaniard.’ (Cf.
§5.18, subsection (2.c.4) for further examples.)

H. Mang-class
bangka (mamangka ‘go boating’ SI)
kimi (mangimi ‘be hesitant to" A)

kupas (mangupas ‘fade’ S!)
nginig (manginig ‘tremble’ SI)
pula (mamula ‘blush, redden’ S1)

Mamangka tayo.
*Let’s go boating.’

Most of the verbs in this class are SI; a few are A (cf. §5.26, class Il.c.5).

A number of bases that occur in this class also occur as unmarked nouns. The mang- verbs often
denote activities - particularly recreational activities — involving the items designated by the nouns.
Compare: bangka ‘boat’; mamangka ‘go boating’; Kabayo ‘horse,’ mangabayo ‘go horseback riding’;
isda ‘fish,’ mangisda ‘go fishing,’ etc.

There is also a subclass of mang- verbs whose bases occur as unaffixed adjectives or as the bases of
ma- adjectives (cf. §4.2 and 4.3). The mang- verb designates the temporary or partial acquisition of
the quality expressed by the adjective. Compare: kupas ‘colorless,’ mangupas ‘fade’; pula ‘red,’
mamula ‘blush, redden’; puri ‘white,’ mamuti ‘blanch’; masakit ‘painful,’ manakit ‘ache’; matigas
‘hard,’ manigas ‘become stiff.’

I. pang... -an class (relatively few bases)
hina (panghinaan ‘feel a weakness in’ A)
pula (pamulahan ‘have a reddening of A)
-nginig (panginigan ‘have a tremor in’ A)
sakit (panaktan ‘have a pain in’ A)

Pinanghinaan siya ng bisig.
‘He felt a weakness in the arm.’

All verbs in this class are A, and express the undergoing of something in a part of the body.

J. -wm- class
bagyo (bumagyo ‘storm’ SI)
buti (bumuti ‘become good, improve (in)’ SI)
dami (dumami ‘become much, be mor than’ SI or A)
dating (dumating ‘arrive’ SI)
-pasa-Maynila (pumasa-Maynila ‘go to Manila’ S1)
sainyo (sumainyo ‘be yours’ SI)

Bumabagyo na.
‘It’s storming now.’

SI verbs like bumagyo, formed with bases that designate natural conditions (cf. bagyo
‘storm’), occur in topicless sentences (cf. §7.21). Other examples are: Aumidiat ‘be lightning’
(cf. kidlat ‘lightning’), gumabi ‘get on toward nighttime’ (cf. gabi ‘night'), wmulan ‘rain’ (cf.
ulan ‘rain’).

Many of the bases that occur in intransitive (SI or A) -wm- verbs also occur as the bases of ma-
adjectives (cf. §4.3), and the verbs, which may be called -a- VERBS OF ‘BECOMING, denote the
acquisition of the quality expressed by the adjective. Their usual English equivalents are ‘become’ or
‘get’ plus an adjective. Compare: mabuti ‘good,’ bumuti ‘become good, improve’; malaki ‘big,’ lumaki
‘get big, grow’; matanda ‘old,’ tumanda ‘get old, age.’ The bases of a few -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ also
occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2), rather than as ma- adjective bases. Compare: payat ‘thin,’
pumayat ‘become thin.” (most unaffixed adjectives occur as bases of ma- verbs of ‘becoming’ — cf.
class D, above — rather than -w- verbs of *becoming.’)

There is a subclass of SI -unz- verb bases related to Jocative adjective phrases (cf. §4.19). In the
verb bases, the na- of the adjective phrase is replaced by pa- /pa/; compare: nasa Maynila ‘in Manila,’
pumasa-Maynila ‘go to Manila.’ There is also a subclass related to possessive sa phrases (cf. §4.22);
compare: sa inyo ‘yours, swmainyo ‘be yours.’ (For further examples of verbs like purmiasa-Maynila
and sumainyo, cf. §5.18, subsection (4.2). For a presentation of A -unt verbs, cf. §5.26, classes
I1.A.7, 11.B.4, and I1.C.6.)

§5.7. Benefactive—focus verbs.

BENEFACTIVE- FOCUS (BF) verbs form predicates that select as topics nominals expressing the
beneficiary of the action: i.e., the (one(s) for whose benefit or in whose stead the action is performed.
Examples are:

Ipagluluto ko ng pagkain si Maria.
‘Pll cook some food for Maria.”

Ipipirma ko ang Tatay.
‘I'll sign (as proxy) for Father.”

The meaning of action performed for someone's benefit is more frequent than that of action done in
someone’s stead. The latter meaning is associated principally with BF verbs that denote activities of a social
nature: ¢.g.,

ikumusta ‘say hello for*

idalo ‘attend (e.g., a social function) for’
ihalik ‘kiss (someone) for’

ipagpaalam ‘say goodbye for’

BF verbs are derived from AF -urm-, mag-, and mang- verbs by replacing the AF affix with the
corresponding BF affix. (Ma- and maka- bases rarely if ever form BF verbs.) Chart 11 gives the productive
affix correspondences:

Examples are:

AF Verb BF Verb
bumili*buy’ ibili ‘buy for’
kumuha ‘get’ ikuha ‘get for’
maglaba ‘launder’ ipaglaba ‘launder for’
magsaing ‘cook rice” ipagsaing ‘cook rice for’
manahi ‘sew’ ipanahi ‘sew for’
manguha ‘gather’ ipanguha ‘gather for’

The topic of a BF verb corresponds to a nominal within a para sa phrase serving as a benefactive adverb
(cf. §6.11, subsection (1.a)) with the corresponding AF verb, Compare, for example:

AF: Bumili ako ng damit para sa bata.
‘I bought some clothes for the child.’

and:

BF:  Ibinili ko ng damit ang bata.
‘I bought some clothes for the child.”

A bencfactive—focus verb takes an actor complement and, additionally, any other complement(s) taken
by the related AF verb. Examples for each of the three complement classes of transitive verbs are:

1. Object Verb:
{ AF: Mag-iihaw si Nene ng isda para kay cai
BF: Ipag-ithaw ni Nene ng isda si Eddie.
‘Nene will broil some fish for Eddie.”

2. Directional verb:
AF: Pipirma ako sa kasulatan para sa Tatay.
{ee Ipipirma ko sa kasulatan ang Tatay. \
‘I'll sign the document for Father.”

3. Double—object verb:
{or Hihingi si Ben ng mga kopya sa titser para sa iyo.
BF: thihingi ka ni Ben ng mga kopya sa titser. \
‘Ben will ask the teacher for some copies for you.’

Examples of intransitive verbs, the BF counterparts of which take actor complements only, are:

{ar Magluluksa sila para sa pinsan nila.
BF: I pagluluksa nila ang pinsan nila.
‘They will wear mourning for their cousin.’

{nr Magnunubena kami para sa kaniya.
BF: Ipagnunubena namin siya.
‘We will say a novena for him.”

312 CHAPTER 5

In addition to BF verbs formed with é, ipag-, and ipang-, there is a small group of -an and pag-. . . -an
verbs with benefactive meanings. The group includes: gawan ‘make (something) for,” iwanan ‘leave
(something) for,’ paglaanan ‘set aside (something) for,’ and firan ‘leave (something) for.’ Gawan isa dialectal
variant of the regular BF formation igawe (cf. gumawa ‘make’), Thus:

AF: Gumawa ka ng damit para sa Nanay.

Igawa

BF: mo ng damit ang Nanay.
Gawan
‘Make a dress for Mother.”

fwanan, paglaanan, and firan are ambiguously DF or BF, since the AF verbs to which they correspond
(respectively, mag-iwan, maglaan, and magtira) accept cither directional complements (formed with sa — cf.
§5.25) or benefactive adverbs to express the one(s) for whom something is ‘left’ or ‘set aside.’ Thus:

Mag-iwan
AF: ka ng pagkain (para) sa akin.
Magtira
Iwanan
DF/BF: mo ako ng pagkain.
Tiran

“Leave some food for me.’

AF: Maglaan ka ng sopas (para) kay Maria.)

DF/BF: Paglaanan mo ng sopas si Maria. j
‘Set aside some soup for Maria.”

There is no regular BF formation corresponding to mag-iwan — i.c., the expected *ipag-iwan fails to occur.
There are, however, regular BF formations corresponding to maglaan and magtira: respectively ipaglaan and
ipagtira. The topics of these regular BF verbs may express either the one(s) for whom something is ‘set aside’ or
‘left? (in which case they are synonymous with paglaanan and tiran respectively) or the one(s) for whose
benefit the action of ‘setting aside something for someone’ or ‘leaving something for someone’ is performed.
Thus:

Ipaglaan

mo ako ng pagkain.
Ipagtira
‘Set aside

some food for me."
“Leave
Ipaglaan }

mo ako (para) kay Maria ng pagkain.
Ipagtira j

‘Set aside
some food for Maria for me.”
‘Leave

§5.8. Causitive—focus verbs.
CAUSATIVE-FOCUS (CF) verbs form predicates that select as topics nominals expressing the cause

of the action. They are derived from transitive and intransitive -win-, ma-, mag- and mang- verbs. Chart 12
gives the affix correspondences:

CHART 12
AF-CF AFFIX CORRESPONDENCES
AF Affix CF Affix
-um- i-, ika-
ma- ika-
mag- i(ka)pag-
mang- i(ka)pang-

(The notations i(ka)pag- and i/ka) pang-indicate free alternation between the forms with and without ka.
Thus: ipag- ~ ikapag-, ipang- ~ikapang-.)

Of the two CF counterparts of -wm-, ika- is the more common. Generally, intransitive -unt verbs of
‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6, class J) have corresponding causative—focus verbs formed with either i- or ika-, the two
occurring as free alternants. Examples are:

AF Verb CF Verb

gumanda ‘become beautiful” iganda/ikaganda ‘cause to become beautiful’
yumaman ‘become rich’ iyaman/ikayaman ‘cause to become rich’
pumayat ‘become thin’ ipayat/ikapayat ‘cause to become thin’

Although there are some exceptions, the majority of wt verbs outside this group correspond to CF ika- verbs
only. In the case of the exceptions, both CF #- and CF ika- verbs occur. In general, the #- verbs imply that the
cause of the action is of some importance, as in:

Iniluha ni Nena ang pagkawala ng alahas niya.
‘The loss of her jewelry made Nena shed tears.”

The i- verbs are avoided, and the ika- verbs used instead, where the cause of the action is regarded as trivial.
Thus:

[kinaluha ni Nena ang usok.
‘The smoke made Nena shed tears.’

(Iniluha and ikinaluha are the perfective forms of, respectively, iluha and ikaluha, both of which correspond to
AF fumuha ‘shed tears.')

At least one AF mag- verb magbili ‘sell,’ has a corresponding CF verb formed with ikapag-
(ikapagbili ‘cause to sell’) but none formed with ipag-. (Ipagbili does, however, occur as the OF
counterpart of magbili.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
314

Other examples of the derivation of CF verbs are:

CHAPTER 5

AF Verb CF Verb

pumunta ‘go’ ikapunta ‘cause to go"
tumakbo ‘run’ ikatakbo ‘cause to run’

magalit ‘get angry” ikagalit ‘cause to get angry’
mag-away ‘fight’ i(ka)pag-away ‘cause to fight’
magturo ‘teach’ i(ka)pagturo ‘cause to teach’
maniwala ‘believe’ i(ka)paniwala ‘cause to believe’
manginig ‘tremble’ i(ka)panginig ‘cause to tremble’

The topic of a CF verb corresponds to a nominal within a dahil sa phrase occurring as a causative
adverb (cf. §6.11, subsection (1.b)) with the corresponding AF verb. The predicate formed by a CF verb
includes an actor complement and, additionally, any other complement(s) taken by the related AF verb.

Examples are:

AF: Nag-away sina Ben at Eddie dahil sa laruan.
“Ben and Eddic fought because of the toy.”

Ipinag-away

CF: nina Ben at Eddie ang laruan.
Ikinapag-away
‘The toy caused Ben and Eddie to fight.’

AF: Nagbili sila ng kanilang kasangkapan dahil sa kahirapan nila.
‘They sold some of their furniture because of their poverty.’

CF: Ikinapagbili nila ng kanilang kasangkapan ang kahirapan nila.
‘Their poverty caused them to sell some of their furniture."

§5.9. Locative—focus verbs.

A LOCATIVE-FOCUS (LF) verb forms a predicate that selects as topic a nominal expressing the
location of the action. LF verbs are derived from certain major AF verbs by replacing the AF affix with the

corresponding LF affix. The affix correspondences are shown in Chart 13.

CHART 13

AF-LF AFFIX CORRESPONDENCES

few cases. Some examples of the correspondences shown in Chart 13 are:

AF Verb LF Verb

mamatay ‘die’ kamatayan ‘die infon’
malunod ‘drown’ kalunuran ‘drown in’
matulog ‘sleep’ pagtulugan ‘sleep in/on’
makakita ‘see’ kakitahan ‘see at/in’

«+. an occurring in only a

AF Verb LF Verb

makarinig ‘hear’ karinggan ‘hear at/in’

sumulat ‘write’ pagsulatan ‘write in/on’
umawit ‘sing’ pag-awitan ‘sing at/in*

maglaro ‘play’ paglaruan ‘play in/on’

magturo ‘teach’ pagturuan ‘teach in’

mamangka ‘go boating” pamangkaaan ‘go boating infon’
mangisda ‘go fishing’ pangisdaan ‘go fishing in/on*

The topic of an LF verb corresponds to a nominal within a sa phrase serving as a locative adverb (cf.
§6.9) with the corresponding AF verb. Compare, for example:

AF: Namamangka ka ba sa ilog?
“Do you go boating on the river?’

and:

LF: Pinamamangkaan mo ba ang ilog?
‘Do you go boating on the river?’

The LF verb takes an actor complement, and, additionally, any other complement(s) taken by the related
AF verb (see examples below).

LF verbs occur less often as predicates than they do as nominalized topics (cf. §3.24). Thus, a
sentence like:

Pinagsulatan ko ang desk na ito.
‘I wrote on this desk.”

represents a less common sentence type than does:

Ang desk na ito ang pinagsulatan ko.
“It’s this desk that I wrote on.”

While there are LF verbs corresponding to many major AF object verbs, double—object verbs, and
intransitive verbs, AF directional verbs do not normally have LF counterparts. It may be noted, in this
connection, that there is considerable formal similarity between LF and DF (direction—focus) verbs. Thus,
all three of the affixes that occur in LF verbs, ka-...-an, pag-... -am, and pang-.. . -an, also occur in DF
verbs. Compare: LF ka-matayan ‘die in/on’ DF kagalitan ‘be angry with’; LF paglaruan ‘play in/on,’ DF
Paghigantihan ‘take revenge on’; LF pangisdaan ‘go fishing in/on,’ DF panghimasukan ‘meddle with.’ But in
spite of the formal similarity between LF verbs and DF verbs, and in spite of the fact that the majority of
major AF verbs have either LF or DF counterparts but not both, there is usually a clear semantic and/or
structural basis for distinguishing the two focus types.

The semantic basis for the distinction between LF and DF verbs is most evident in the case of
double—object verbs, the only complement class of verbs that allows of a direct comparison between LF
and DF verbs formed with the same base and corresponding to the same AF verb. In the case of such verbs,
there is a clear semantic contrast between the two focus types. Compare, for example:

LF: Pinaghahaluan ni Rosa ng asukal sa kape ang kapitera.
‘Rosa stirs sugar into the coffee in the coffee pot.’
(or, more commonly:
Ang kapitera ang pinaghahaluan ni Rosa ng asukal sa kape.
‘It’s in the coffee pot that Rosa stirs sugar into the coffee.”

and:

DF: Hinahaluan ni Rosa ng asukal ang kape sa kapitera.
‘Rosa stirs sugar into the coffee in the coffee pot.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
316 CHAPTER 5

In these examples, the LF verb pinaghahaluan (the imperfective form of paghaluan) selects as topic ang
kapitera ‘the coffee pot,’ which expresses the location of the action of ‘stirring,’ while the DF verb
hinahaluan (the imperfective form of haluan) selects as topic ang kape ‘the coffee,’ which expresses the
directional goal of this action. (The sentences with the LF and DF verbs both correspond to AF:

Naghahalo si Rosa ng asukal sa kape sa kapitera.
‘Rosa stits sugar into the coffee in the coffee pot.’)

Another example of this type of contrast is:

LF: Ang iskwelang iyon ang pagtuturuan niya ng Tagalog sa mga Amerikano.
‘It’s in that school that he'll teach the American Tagalog.”

DF: Tuturuan niya ng Tagalog ang mga Amerikano sa iskwelang iyon.
‘He'll teach the American Tagalog in that school.’

(cf. AF: Magtuturo siya ng Tagalog sa mga Amerikano sa iskwelang iyon.
‘He'll teach the American Tagalog in that school.*)

Once more the LF verb (pagtuturuan) focuses upon a phrase expressing the location of the action (ang
iskwelang iyon ‘that school’), the DF verb (tuturuan) upon a phrase expressing the directional goal of the
action (ang mga Amerikano ‘the Americans’).

In the case of LF verbs derived from AF object verbs and intransitive verbs, no direct LF—DF
comparison is possible (since such AF verbs lack DF counterparts.) A comparison may, however, be made
instead between such LF verbs and superficially similar DF verbs formed with the same affix. Compare, for
example, the LF and DF ka-. . . -an formations in the following sentences:

LF: Kinamatayan nila ang bundok na iyon.
‘They died on that mountain."

(cf. AF: Namatay sila sa bundok na iyon.
‘They died on that mountain.’)

DF: Kinaawaan nila ang pulubing iyon.
‘They took pity on that beggar.”

(cf. AF: Naawa sila sa pulubing iyon.
‘They took pity on that beggar.’)

In the examples, kinamatayan, an LF verb, corresponds to the intransitive AF verb namatay, while
kinaawaan, a DF verb, corresponds to the directional AF verb naawa. Several types of contrasts may be
noted between the two ka-...-an verbs, First, there is a semantic contrast of the kind already noted: i.e.,
the topic of Kinamatayan represents the location of an action, that of kinaawaan the directional goal of an
action, Second, there is a structural contrast between the LF verb whose topic corresponds to a completely
optional element (i.e., a locative adverb) in the related AF sentence, and the DF verb whose topic
corresponds to a semi-obligatory element (i.e., a directional complement) in the related AF sentence. Thus,
while the sentence:

Namatay sila.
‘They died.”

is complete in itself, and does not imply a deleted locative adverb, the sentence:

Naawa sila.
‘They took pity (on someone).”

if it occurs at all, strongly implies a deleted directional goal.

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 317

Since the topic (or predicate) that occurs opposite an LF verb expresses, in general, the location of
the action, it is normally an unmarked noun or deictic pronoun representing a place. Some further
examples of LF sentences and their AF counterparts are:

AF: Nagbayo sila ng palay sa lusong. \
LF: Pinagbayuhan nila ng palay ang lusong.
‘They pounded rice in the mortar.’

AF: Naglalaro kami ng tses sa mesang maliit.
LF: Pinaglalaruan namin ng tses ang mesang maliit.
‘We play chess on the small table.”

AF: Nagluto si Helen ng karne sa kawali.
LF: Pinaglutuan ni Helen ng karne ang kawali.
‘Helen cooked some meat in the frying pan.”

§5.10. Referential—focus and measurement—focus verbs.

REFERENTIAL~FOCUS (RIF) verbs express actions involving communication, and select as topics
nominals that denote the subject matter of the communication. The topic of an RIF verb usually
corresponds to an ‘about’ phrase in English.

R{F verbs are derived from certain intransitive mag- verbs (cf. §5.6, class G) that express joint actions
involving communication. In the RfF verbs, mag- is replaced by pag-...-an. Some examples of the
correspondence between intransitive mag- verbs and RfF pag-. . . -ant verbs are:

Intransitive mag-Verb REF pag- ... .-an Verb

mag-away ‘quarrel’ pag-awayan ‘quarrel about’
magkasundo ‘be in agreement’ pagkasunduan ‘be in agreement about’
magpulong ‘have a meeting” pagpulungan ‘have a meeting about’
magtalo ‘argue’ pagtaluhan ‘argue about’

mag-usap ‘converse, talk” Pag-usapan ‘talk about"

The topic of an RIF verb commonly corresponds to a nominal within a fungkol sa referential adverb
(cf. §6.11, subsection (I.c)) that occurs with the related miag- verb. The RfF verb takes an actor
complement that corresponds to the topic of the mag- verb. Compare:

AF: Nag-away sila tungkol sa pera,
RfF: Pinag-awayan nila ang pera.
‘They quarreled about the money.’

AF: Nag-usap sina Rudy tungkol sa giyera.
RF: Pinag-usapan nina Rudy ang giyera.
“Rudy and the others talked about the war.”

Quite frequently a nominalized referential adjective phrase (cf. §4.20, subsection (5)) occurs in place
of a nominal as topic of an REF verb. (Like referential adverbs, referential adjective phrases are commonly
introduced by tungkol sa.) A referential phrase occurring as topic of an REF verb is often translatable by a
phrase introduced by ‘about the matter of or ‘about matters concerning’ in English. Examples are:

Pinag-awayan nila ang tungkol sa pera.
‘They quarreled about the matter of the money.”

Pinag-usapan nina Rudy ang tungkol sa giyera.
‘Rudy and the others talked about matters concerning the war.”

318 CHAPTER 5

In addition to genuine RfF verbs, there are a number of verbs formed with é, -in, or ipag- that have
referential meanings: e.g., ikwento ‘tell a story about,’ isipin ‘think about’ jpaglihim ‘be secretive about.”
These are best interpreted as OF verbs whose topics correspond to object complements occurring with
related AF verbs. Thus:

{or Magkwento ka noon.
OF: ikwento mo iyon.
‘Tell a story about that.”

{or Nag-isip siya ng paglalakbay wert
OF: Inisip niya ang paglalakbay niya.
‘He thought about his trip.”

{ AF: Naglihim sila ng gawain nila.
OF: Ipinaglihim nila ang gawain nila.
‘They were secretive about their activities.”

The AF verbs do, however, accept referential adverbs in place of object complements. Thus, also:

Magkwento ka tungkol doon.
‘Tell a story about that.’

Nag-isip siya tungkol sa paglalakbay niya.
‘He thought about his trip.”

Naglihim sila tungkol sa gawain nila.
‘They wre secretive about their activities.”

There is also at least one genuine RF verb formed with ipag-, ipagtanong ‘ask (more than one person)
about.” The relation of this verb to the AF verb magtanong is not altogether clear, since a directional

complement occurring with magtanong may be either singular or plural in reference, while a directional
complement occurring with ipagtanong must be plural in reference. Thus:

( kaniya
Magtanong ka sa tungkol doon.
{ kanila
him )
‘Ask about that.”
them {
but only:

Ipagtanong mo iyon sa kanila.
‘Ask them about that.’
(There is no: *Ipagtanong mo iyon sa kaniya.)

Measurement—focus (MF) verbs express actions involving measurable change, like increase in weight,

size, etc. They are derived from a subclass of intransitive -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6, Class J). In the
MF verbs, -wr- is replaced by &. Some examples of correspondences between intransitive -um- verbs are:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 319

-um- Verb MF i- Verb

bumigat ibigat ‘gain in weight (become heavy)’
lumaki ilaki ‘grow (become big)’

tumaas itaas ‘grow (become tall)”

tumagal itagal ‘last (become long)’

umunlad iunlad ‘progress (become advanced)

MF verbs take actor complements corresponding to the topics of the -w- verbs from which they are
derived. The construction formed by the MF verb and the actor complement occurs only as a nominalized
verbal in topic position (cf. §3.24). The predicate opposite which this construction occurs corresponds to
an expression of measurement found within a nang measurement adverb occurring with the related -we-
verb (cf. §6.11, subsection (3)). Compare:

MF: Tatlong pulgada ang inilaki ng bata.
‘The child grew three inches.”
(but not:
*Inilaki ng bata ang tatlong pulgada.

{ AF: Lumaki nang tatlong pulgada ang bata. \

AF: Tatagal nang dalawang oras ang pulong.
MF: Dalawang oras ang itatagal ng pulong.
‘The meeting will last two hours.’

{ AF: Umunlad nang malaki ang bayan.
MF: Malaki ang iniunlad ng bayan.
‘The nation has progressed a lot.”

§5.11. Reservational—focus and instrumental—focus verbs.

RESERVATIONAL-FOCUS (RF) verbs are formed by affixing the prefix & to a reservational
adjective; INSTRUMENTAL~ FOCUS (IF) verbs are, in general, formed by affixing the prefix i- to an
instrumental adjective (see below for exceptions). The formation of reservational and instrumental
adjectives is presented in detail in §4.8. As is noted in that section, both types of adjectives consist of the
prefix pang- plus a base or, in the case of certain instrumental adjectives of pampa- plus a base. In the case
of reservational adjectives, the base is ordinarily a noun, and the adjective has the meaning ‘reserved or
intended for use on/in’ what the base designates: e.g., pambubong ‘for (use on) the roof (cf. bubong
‘roof’), pangkape ‘for (use in) coffee’ (cf. kape ‘coffee’). A subclass of reservational adjectives has the
specialized meaning ‘reserved or intended for wear in/at’ what the base designates: e.g., pangkasal ‘for
(wear at) a wedding’ (cf. kasal ‘wedding’), pang-opisina ‘for (wear in) an office’ (cf. opisina ‘office’). (There
are, in addition, reservational adjectives whose bases are cardinal or ordinal numbers, and a very few whose
bases do not occur independently, but do occur as verb bases — cf. §4.8.)

In the case of instrumental adjectives, the base also occurs as a verb base, and the adjective has the
meaning ‘for use in performing’ the action designated by the related actor—focus verb formed with the
same base. Examples are: panghabi ‘for use in weaving’ (cf. /umabi ‘weave’), pangwalis ‘for use in
sweeping’ (cf. magwalis ‘sweep’), pangusina (or pampangusina — sce below) ‘for use in cooking” (cf.
mangusina ‘cook’), pampatulog ‘for use in putting to sleep’ (cf. magpatulog ‘put to sleep’).

The rules governing the form of reservational and instrumental adjectives may be summarized as
follows:

(1) In reservational adjectives, the prefix has one of three forms: pam- /pam/ if the base begins with
J pf or /b/; parr fpan/ if the base begins with /t/, /d/, /s/, or /1/; pang- /pan/ in other cases.

(2) In instrumental adjectives whose bases occur in related -ur- or mag- verbs and begin with /p/, /t/,
/sf, or /k/, there are two alternative formations: one that is identical with the formation of reservational
adjectives whose bases begin with these consonants, and another in which the initial base consonant is

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
320 CHAPTER 5

replaced by its homorganic nasal counterpart — /p/ by /mf, /t/ or /s/ by /n/, /k/ by /n/ — and the final nasal
of the prefix is simultaneously lost.

(3) In instrumental adjectives whose bases occur in related -m- or mag- verbs and begin with some
consonant other than /p/, /t/, /s/, or /k/, the formation of the adjective is identical with that of a
reservational adjective with the same base—initial consonant.

(4) In instrumental adjectives whose bases occur in related mang- verbs, pam- /pam/ is prefixed toa
formation in which /p/ replaces the initial /m/ of the verbal affix; in some cases, the initial /pam/ of the
adjectival formation is optionally deletable. (Examples of the operation of the above rules are presented in
§4.8. It may be noted that the rules governing formations with the adjectival prefix pang- differ from those
governing formations with the verbal prefix pang-. The latter resemble the rules for the formation of mang-
verbs which are presented in §5.2, subsection (12).)

Some examples of the correspondence of reservational adjectives and RF verbs are:

Reservational Adjective RF Verb

pambahay ‘for (wear in) the house’ ipambahay ‘wear in the house’
pansimba ‘for (wear in) church’ ipansimba ‘wear in church"
pansopas ‘for (use in) soup’ ipansopas ‘use in soup”

pangkape ‘for (use in) coffee’ ipangkape ‘use in coffee’
pangkunsyerto ‘for use in/at a concert” ipangkunsyerto ‘use in/at a concert’

As the translations show, RF verbs usually correspond to English constructions with ‘wear in/at’ or ‘use
infat.’
Some examples of the correspondence of instrumental adjectives and IF verbs are:

Instrumental Adjective IF Verb
pampunas ipampunas )

‘for use in wiping’ ‘wipe with’
pamunas ipamunas {
pansuklay ipansuklay )

‘for use in combing’ ‘comb with’
panuklay ipanuklay j
pangguhit ‘for use in drawing’ ipangguhit “draw with’
pangwalis ‘for use in sweeping’ ipangwalis ‘sweep with’
pampangusina ipampangusina )

‘for use in cooking’ | cook with’
pangusina ipangusina \
pampatulog ‘for use in putting to sleep’ ipampatulog ‘put to sleep with’

As the translations show, IF verbs usually correspond to English verbs followed by ‘with.’

The topic of an IF verb designates the instrument with which an action is performed. The verb takes
an actor complement designating the user(s) of the instrument, and, in addition, any other complement(s)
taken by the related actor—focus verb formed with the same base. Examples are:

Ipinampunas

ng katulong ng kasangkapan ang basahang iyon.
Ipinamunas
‘The maid wiped furniture with that rag.”

(cf. Nagpunas ang katulong ng kasangkapan.
‘The maid wiped furniture.’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 321

Ipinapambili nila ng mga kagamitan sa tindahan ang perang Amerikano.
‘They buy goods at the store with American money.”

(cf. Bumibili sila ng mga kagamitan sa tindahan.
‘They buy goods at the store.”)

Ipinampapatulog ng duktor ng pasyente ang gamot.
‘The doctor is putting a patient to sleep with the drug.’

(cf. Nagpapatulog ng pasyente ang duktor.
‘The doctor is putting a patient to sleep.”)

In a limited number of cases, IF verbs show, in addition to formations that involve i- plus an
instrumental adjective, alternative formations that involve either é- or ipag- plus the base of the instrumental
adjective. These alternative formations normally occur only when the base of the instrumental adjective
itself designates an instrument. Thus the base suklay ‘(a) comb,’ which occurs in the instrumental adjective
pansuklay {panuklay ‘for use in combing’ (cf. magsuklay ‘(to) comb’) appears in the IF~verb formations
isuklayi and ipagsuklay as well as in ipansuklay and ipanuklay. (All four formations mean ‘comb with.’)
Some further examples of such alternative IF formations are:

igunting/ipaggunting/ipanggunting ‘cut with’ (base: gunting ‘scissors*)
isandok/ipagsandok/ipansandok ‘ladle with’ (base: sandok ‘ladle’)
isipilyo/ipagsipilyo/ipansipilyo ‘brush with’ (base: sipilyo ‘brush’)

When the base of the instrumental adjective does not itself designate an instrument, the alternative i- and
ipag- formations do not normally occur. Thus there are no IF verbs *ihalo and *ipaghalo alternating with
ipanghalo ‘mix with.’ (A few common bases that do not designate instruments, however, occur in the
alternative formation. Thus ibili~ipambili ‘buy with,’ iguhit~ipangguhit ‘draw with,’ isulat~ipan(s\ulat
‘write with.’ These bases do not form IF verbs with ipag-.)

§5.12. Indirect—action verbs.

All the verbs presented in § §5.3 through 5.11 may be called direct—action verbs, in that they express
the direct performance of an action by the person(s), etc., designated by the actor topic (in the case of
actor—focus verbs) or the actor complement (in the case of goal-focus verbs). Tagalog also has a sct of
INDIRECT- ACTION VERBS. In the case of these verbs, all of which are formed with complex affixes that
include the prefix pa- /pa/, the person(s), etc., designated by the actor topic or actor complement are not
necessarily expressed as performing the action of the verb, but, rather, as permitting or causing this action
to be performed. The English equivalents of such verbs often involve ‘let,’ ‘make,’ or ‘have’ plus verb: e.g.,

Nagpaluto ako ng adobo kay Rosa.
‘I let/(made/had Rosa cook some adobo.”

There are eight different focus types of indirect—action verbs. Seven of these are the indirect—action
counterparts of direct—action—verb focus types presented in previous sections: actor focus (AF), object
focus (OF), directional focus (DF), benefactive focus (BF), causative focus (CF), locative focus (LF), and
referential focus (R{F). The eighth is a focus type peculiar to indirect—action verbs, which may be called
SECONDARY- ACTOR focus (A2F). The various focus types of indirect—action verbs are presented below
under the following headings: (1) AF indirect-action verbs; (2) A2F indirect—action verbs; (3) OF and DF
indirect—action verbs; (4) other indirect—action verbs.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
322 CHAPTER 5

(1) AF INDIRECT- ACTION VERBS. AF indirect—action verbs select as topics nominals denoting
the person(s) etc., permitting or causing the action to be performed. They are in all cases formed with the
prefix magpa-, whatever the affix of the corresponding AF direct—action verb formed with the same base.
(Bases that form AF direct—action verbs only with mang- (e.g., isda ‘fish’ - mangisda ‘go fishing’) do not
form AF indirect—action verbs.) Examples are:

AF Direct—Action Verb AF Indirect—Action Verb

mahinog ‘get ripe’ magpahinog ‘permit/cause to get ripe’
makakita ‘see’ magpakita ‘permit/cause to see*
magwalis ‘sweep’ magpawalis ‘permit/cause to sweep”
sumulat ‘write’ magpasulat ‘permit/cause to write’

As is noted in §5.2, subsection (17), there are many pairs of major -um- and mag- verbs formed with
the same base: e.g., dumabas ‘go out’ and maglabas ‘bring/take out’; wmuwi ‘go home’ and mag-uwi
‘bring/take home.” Since the AF indirect—action verbs that correspond to direct—action -wm- and mag-
verbs are formed with the same prefix, magpa- it follows that the formal distinction between pairs of verbs
like lumabas and maglabas or umuwi and mag-uwi is lost in the corresponding indirect—action verbs. Thus
magpalabas may mean either ‘permit/cause to go out” or ‘permit/cause to bring/take out,’ and magpauwi
may mean cither ‘permit/cause to go home’ or *permit/cause to bring/take home.” The ambiguity of such
verbs is resolved only by context. (Similar ambiguity occurs in the case of certain indirect—action verbs of
focus types presented in subsections (3) and (4), below. No special note is made of such ambiguity in these
subsections.)

AF indirect—action verbs may take any complement(s) taken by the corresponding direct-action verb,
plus, in most cases (see below for exceptions), a SECONDARY-ACTOR COMPLEMENT. The
secondary—actor complement expresses the person(s), etc., permitted or caused to perform the action. In
form, the secondary—actor complement taken by an AF indirect—action verb is in some cases identical with
a directional complement, in others with an object complement. (Cf. §5.25 for a summary of the forms of
directional and object complements.) The secondary—actor complement has the form of a directional
complement when the corresponding direct—action verb is a transitive verb belonging to the object or
double—object complement class (cf. §§5.3 and 5.5, respectively). Thus in the following sentences, the

secondary—actor complement is expressed by the sa phrase sa katulong ‘the maid,’ which is identical in
form with a directional complement:

Magpawalis ka ng bakuran sa katulong.
‘Let/Have the maid sweep the yard.”

Magpabili ka ng sigarilyo sa tindahan sa katulong.
‘Let/Have the maid buy some cigarettes at the store.”

(Magwalis, the direct—action verb that corresponds to magpawalis, is an object verb. Bumili, the
direct—action verb that corresponds to magpabili, is a double—object verb.)

(Since the secondary—actor complement and the directional complement are identical in form after
an AF indirect—action verb that corresponds to a double—object verb, there are many cases of ambiguity.
Thus the sentence:

Magpabigay ka ng pera kay Rosa kay Maria.

can mean cither ‘Have Rosa give some money to Maria’ (in which case kay Rosa is interpreted as a
secondary—actor complement, kay Maria as a directional complement) or ‘Have Maria give some money to
Rosa’ (in which case kay Rosa is interpreted as a directional complement, Kay Maria as a secondary —actor
complement). This kind of ambiguity, which can be resolved only by context, can occur in the case of
various other focus—types of indirect—action verbs that correspond to direct—action double—object verbs.)

The secondary—actor complement has the form of an object complement when the corresponding
direct—action verb is a transitive verb belonging to the directional complement class (cf. §5.4) or is

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 323

intransitive (cf. §5.6). (As is specified in §5.25, subsection (2), an object complement within a
non-nominalized verbal is expressed by ang phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the
ng form of a deictic pronoun, Within a nominalized verbal, the object complement is expressed by either a
ng phrase or a sa phrase if the nominal within the complement is an unmarked noun or a deictic pronoun,
and is expressed by asa phrase if the nominal within the complement is an unmarked noun or a deictic
pronoun, and is expressed by a sa phrase if the nominal within the complement is a personal noun or a
personal pronoun.) Thus in the following sentences the secondary--actor complements are identical in form
with object complements occurring in similar contexts:

{ ng bata
Nagpapunta siya sa tindahan.
noon
a child }
“He Iet/had go to the store.”
one of those {
f ng bata}
Nagpapatulog sila
| noon {
j a child )
‘She's putting to bed.’
one of those
(Literally: ‘She's letting/having...sleep.”)
ng )
bata
=|
noon )
Siya ang nagpapunta : sa tindahan.
doon \
kay Jose
sa kaniya
a/the
child
the
one of those )
‘He’s the one who Ict/had . go to the store.”
that one {
Jose
him

(Pumunta, the direct-action verb that corresponds to magpapunta is a directional verb. Matulog, the
direct—action verb that corresponds to magpatulog, is an intransitive verb.) As the above examples show,
secondary—actor complements that have the form of object complements carry the same meanings of
definiteness or indefinitencss as are carried by object complements occurring in similar contexts.

There is at least one AF indirect—action verb that constitutes an exception to the above
generalizations. This is the verb magpakain ‘feed’ (literally, ‘permit/cause to cat’), which corresponds to the

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
324 CHAPTER 5

double—object direct—action verb kumain ‘eat.’ When magpakain is followed by an object complement, the
formation of the secondary—actor complement is regular; that is, it is identical in form with a directional
complement: c¢.g.,

Magpakain ka ng darak sa baboy.
‘Feed the pig some rice bran.”

(The indirect—actor complement in the above sentence is sa baboy ‘the pig.”) When, however, magpakain is
not followed by an object complement, the secondary—actor complement is identical in form with an
object complement. Thus:

Magpakain ka ng baboy.

a
‘Feed pig.”
the

(in the case of other indirect—action verbs, only a sa-phrase secondary—actor complement would occur in
similar structures. Thus:

Magpawalis ka sa katulong.
“Let/Have the maid sweep.”

but not:
*Magpawalis ka ng katulong.)

(Secondary—actor complements also occur with indirect—action verbs of the focus types presented in
subsections (3) and (4), below. With these focus types, the secondary—actor complement is always in the
form of a sa phrase.)

Certain AF indirect—action verbs that correspond to intransitive direct—action verbs may occur
without a secondary—actor complement in a REFLEXIVE INDIRECT-—ACTION CONSTRUCTION. The
direct—action verbs to which these indirect—action verbs correspond are, for the most part, mia- and -um-
verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6, classes D and J), and the meaning of the indirect—action verb is ‘permit/cause
oneself to become __.” Some examples are:

Nagpapapagod si Nene.
‘Nene is letting herself get tired."

(cf. Napapagod si Nene.
‘Nene is getting tired.”)

Nagpapataba si Nene.
‘Nenc is trying to put on weight.”
(Literally: ‘Nene is making herself get fat.”)

(cf. Tumataba si Nene.
‘Nene is getting fat.’)

Sentences like those just illustrated are at least potentially ambiguous. For, in addition to the
teflexive interpretation shown in the English translations above, the sentences allow of a non-reflexive
interpretation as well. This latter interpretation involves the assumed deletion of a secondary—actor
complement after the verb. (A secondary—actor complement, like other complements, is optionally
deletable in cases where its referent is indefinite or is clear from context.) Thus, for example, Nagpapataba

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 325

¢ bewl Ewe Bani BEe~ess eyes em ae entT

si Nene may also be interpreted as meaning ‘Nene is fattening something,’ in which case the sentence is
taken to be similar in meaning to a sentence like:

Nagpapataba ng manok si Nene.
‘Nene is fattening a chicken.”
(Literally: ‘Nene is making a chicken get fat.’)

(The reflexive meaning may be made unambiguous by the inclusion in the sentence of a reflexive nominal
construction (cf. §3.21) serving as a secondary—actor complement. Thus:

Nagpapataba ng sarili (niya) si Nene.
‘Nene is trying to put on weight.’

Since the reflexive meaning, when intended, is usually clear from context, this use of a reflexive
secondary —actor complement is relatively rare.)

There are at least two AF indirect—action verbs that are always reflexive in meaning. These are the
verbs magpatihulog ‘make oneself fall down‘ and magpatirapa ‘make oneself fall face down,’ which
correspond, respectively, to the intransitive direct—action verbs mahulog ‘fall down’ and madapa ‘fall face
down.’ Examples in sentences are:

Nagpatihulog sa hagdanan ang bata.
‘The child made himself fall down the steps.’

(cf. Nahulog sa hagdanan ang bata.
‘The child fell down the steps.”)

Nagpatirapa siya.
‘He made himself fall face down.”

(cf. Nadapa siya.
‘He fell face down.’)

It may be noted that these two reflexive indirect—action verbs include in addition to the usual prefix
magpa- a further prefix, ti-. This prefix, which occurs only in the reflexive verbs and their derivatives (e.g.,
the gerunds pagpapatihutog ‘making oneself fall down’ and pagpapatirapa ‘making oneself fall face down’),
is always associated with a meaning of (deliberate) reflexive action.

In addition to the reflexive constructions already discussed, there are also certain reflexive
constructions that involve AF indirect—action verbs corresponding to transitive direct—action verbs. These
constructions normally include a secondary—actor complement, but lack some other complement of a type
taken by the corresponding direct—action verb. An example is:

Nagpahuli ang magnanakaw sa pulis.
let himself be caught by the police.’
‘The thief

| let the police catch him.”

Nagpahuli, in the example, lacks an object complement. The corresponding direct—action verb, humuli, is
usually followed by such a complement: e.g.,

Humuli ng magnanakaw ang pulis.
‘The police caught a thief.’

It is the absence of an object complement after nagpahuli that allows the sentence to be interpreted
reflexively. Similarly, in the following sentence:

Elements sous droits d'auteur
326 CHAPTER S$

Nagpatulong sa bata ang Nanay,
‘Mother let the child help her.’

(cf. Tumulong ang bata sa Nanay.
‘The child helped mother.’)

It is the absence of a directional complement after nagpatulong that allows of the reflexive interpretation.

The potential for the reflexive use of an AF indirect—action verb that corresponds to a transitive
direct—action verb exists whenever the direct—action verb accepts as object or directional complement a
nominal that can also occur as the topic of the indirect—action verb. (Thus the potential generally exists if
the direct-action verb accepts an object or directional complement with animate reference.) In all cases,
however, that allow of a reflexive interpretation, a non-reflexive interpretation is also possible. Thus
Nagpahuli ang magnanakaw sa pulis may also be interpreted as meaning ‘The thief let the police catch
someone/something,’ and Nagpatulong sa bata ang Nanay as meaning ‘Mother let the child help (someone).”
In these latter interpretations, the absence of the usual object or directional complement is taken to reflect
an optional deletion of the complement, rather than a reflexive construction.

(Various goal—focus counterparts of the reflexive indirect—action constructions presented above
occur. No special note is made of the occurrence of such constructions in subsequent subsections.)

(2) A2F INDIRECT-ACTION VERBS. A2F indirect—action verbs select as topics nominals denoting
the person(s), etc. permitted or caused to perform the action of the verb. They are derived from certain
transitive or intransitive AF direct—action verbs by replacing the AF direct—action affix with the
corresponding A2F indirect—action affix. The affix correspondences are shown in Chart 14.

CHART 14
CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN AF DIRECT-ACTION AND
A2F INDIRECT—ACTION AFFIXES

AF Direct—Action Affix A2F Indirect—Action Affix
ma-, -um- pa-...-in
mag- papag-...-in
mang- papang....-in

Examples are:
AF Direct—Action Verb A2F Indirect—Action Verb
matulog ‘sleep’ patulugin ‘permit/cause to sleep’
matuyo ‘get dry’ patuyuin ‘permit/cause to get dry’
bumalik ‘retun’ pabalikin ‘permit/cause to return’
lumakad ‘walk’ palakarin ‘permit/cause to walk’
magsapatos ‘wear shoes’ papagsapatusin ‘permit/cause to wear shoes’
magturo ‘teach’ papagturuin ‘permit/cause to teach’
manood ‘watch’ papanoorin ‘permit/cause to watch’
mangibig ‘pay court to’ papangibigin ‘permit/cause to pay court to”

A2F verbs take an actor complement that expresses the person(s), etc., permitting or causing the
action to be performed, plus any other complement(s) taken by the corresponding AF direct—action verb.
Examples in sentences are:

Patutuyuin ko ang damit.
‘TI let the dress get dry.’

(cf. Matutuyo ang damit.
‘The dress will get dry.”)

Pinabalik ni Dr. Magpayo ang pasyente sa opisina.
‘Dr. Magpayo had the patient return to the office.’

‘The patient returned to the office.")

Papagtuturuin nila siya ng aritmetika sa mga bata.
‘They'll have him teach the children arithmetic.’

(cf. Magtuturo siya ng aritmetika sa mga bata.
‘He'll teach the children arithmetic.”)

Pinapanood ng Tatay ng telebisyon sina Boy.
‘Father let Boy and the others watch television.”

(cf. Nanood ng telebisyon sina Boy.
‘Boy and the others watched television.’)

(It may be noted that the topic of an A2F indirect—action verb corresponds semantically to the topic of
the AF direct—action verb from which it is derived.)

(3) OF AND DF INDIRECT-ACTION VERBS. OF indirect—action verbs are derived from OF
(object and double—object) direct—action verbs. If the affix of the direct—action verb is -an, that of the

corresponding direct—action verb is pa-...-an. In all other cases, the affix of the indirect—action verb is ipa-.
Examples are:

OF Direct—Action Verb OF Indirect—Action Verb

buksan ‘open’ pabuksan ‘permit/cause to open’
pintahan ‘paint’ papintahan ‘permit/cause to paint’
itago ‘hide/keep’ ipatago ‘permit/cause to hide/keep’
ibigay ‘give’ ipabigay ‘permit/cause to give”
alisin ‘remove’ ipaalis ‘permit/cause to remove’
linisin ‘clean’ ipalinis ‘permit/cause to clean’
makita ‘see’ ipakita ‘permit/cause to see’
mahalata ‘notice’ ipahalata ‘permit/cause to notice’

(Complex OF direct—action affixes —e.g., ipag- and pag-...-an- rarely, if ever, have indirect—action
counterparts. Thus there are no OF indirect—action verbs corresponding to such direct—action verbs as
ipagbili ‘sell’ or pag-aralan ‘study.”)

DF indirect—action verbs are derived from DF (directional and double—object) direct—action verbs.
Pa-...-an is the DF indirect—action counterpart of both -an and -in. Examples are:

DF Direct—Action Verb DF Indirect—Action Verb

tingnan ‘look at’ patingnan ‘permit/cause to look at’
sulatan ‘write to” pasulatan ‘permit/cause to write to”
akyatin ‘climb’ paakyatan ‘permit/cause to climb’
pasukin ‘enter’ papasukan ‘permit/cause to enter”

(Complex DF direct—action affixes — e.g., ka-...-an and pag-...-an — rarely, if ever, have indirect—action
counterparts. Thus there are no DF indirect—action verbs corresponding to such direct—action verbs as
kamuhian ‘hate’ oc pagbatayan ‘base (a decision) on.’)

The topic of an OF or DF indirect—action verb is the same as that of the direct—action verb from
which it is derived. The indirect—action verb accepts an actor complement, a secondary—actor complement,
and any directional or object complement taken by the direct—action verb (i.e., a directional complement
in the case of an OF double—object verb, an object complement in the case of a DF double—object verb.)

328 CHAPTER 5

The actor complement occurring with the indirect—action verb expresses the person(s), etc., permitting or
causing the action to be performed, The secondary—actor complement expresses the person(s), etc.,
permitted or caused to perform the action. (For the form of the secondary—actor complement, cf. (1)
above. It may be noted that a secondary—actor complement occurring with an OF or DF indirect—action
verb — as well as one occurring with any of the various focus types of indirect—action verbs presented in
subsection (4), below —corresponds semantically to the actor complement occurring with the

direct—action verb from which the indirect—action verb is derived.) Some examples of OF indirect—action
verbs in sentences are:

Pinabuksan ko kay Pedro ang kahon.
‘I had Pedro open the box.’

(cf. Binuksan ni Pedro ang kahon.
‘Pedro opened the box.’)

Ipinaalis ng titser kay Jose ang mapa sa dingding.
‘The teacher made Jose remove the map from the wall.”

(cf. Inalis ni Jose ang mapa sa dingding.
‘Jose removed the map from the wall.’)

Some examples of DF indirect—action verbs in sentences are:

Pinasulatan siya sa akin ng liham ang alkalde.
‘He had me write a letter to the mayor.’

(cf. Sinulatan ko ng liham ang alkalde.
‘I wrote a letter to the mayor.” )

Pinapasukan ng bantay sa mga bisita ang museo.
‘The guard let some visitors into the museum.”

(cf. Pinasok ng mga bisita ang museo.
‘The visitors entered the museum.’)

(3) OTHER INDIRECT-ACTION VERBS. The remaining focus types of indirect—action verbs are
derived from the various derived focus types of direct—action verbs presented in §5.7 through 5.10. The
correspondences between the direct—action and indirect—action affixes that occur in the several focus

types are shown in Chart 15, In cases where the chart lists two indirect—action affixes within braces, the
two are free of dialectal alternants.

(Instrumental—focus (IF) and reservational—focus (RF) indirect—action verbs do not occur. For
example, there is no *ipapangeawa (cf., the direct—action IF verb ipanggawa ‘use for making’) or
*ipapambahay (cf., the direct—action RF verb ipambahay ‘wear in the house’)—cf. §5.10 for a
presentation of direct—action IF and RF verbs. Note, however, that there are direct—action IF verbs whose
bases include the indirect—action prefix pa-: e.g., ipampatulog ‘use in putting to sleep,’ which may be
analyzed as consisting of the IF prefix i- plus the derived base pampatulog ‘for use in putting to sleep’ (or,
more literally, ‘for use in causing (someone) to sleep’) — cf. magpatulog ‘put to sleep.”

Indirect—action verbs of types whose formation is summarized in Chart 15 all accept — potentially, at
least — an actor complement (which, as with other types of indirect—action verbs, expresses the person(s),
etc., permitted or caused to perform the action — cf. (1) above, for rules of formation), and, in addition,
any object and/or directional complement accepted by the corresponding direct—action verb. The topic of
the indirect—action verb has the same scmantic relation to the action as does the topic of a direct—action
verb of the same focus type. Thus the topic of a BF indirect—action verb expresses the person(s), etc.,
receiving the benefit of the action, that of a CF indirect—action verb the cause of the action, etc. Examples
of BF indirect—action verbs in sentences are:

Ipinagpagawa ko ng diyaket sa sastre si Juan.
‘Thad the tailor make a jacket for Juan.’

Ipagpapalinis ko kayo ng mesa sa katulong.
‘T'll have the maid clean a table for you.’

330 CHAPTER 5

Examples of CF indirect—action verbs in sentences are:

Ikinapagpakain nila ng lugaw sa mga bata ang kanilang kahirapan.
‘Their poverty caused them to fced the children rice gruel.’
(Literally: ‘Their poverty caused them to have the children eat rice gruel.”)

Ikinapagpabunot ni Eddie ng ngipin sa dentista ang sakit.
‘The pain caused Eddie to have the dentist pull (his) tooth.’

(As the examples show, CF indirect—action verbs express two different kinds of causation, one
characteristic of causative verbs in general, the other of indirect—action verbs in general. Causative verbs
normally express actions whose occurrence is caused by some particular condition (or event).
Indirect—action verbs normally express actions whose occurrence is caused (or permitted) by some
particular person(s). In sentences with CF indirect—action verbs in predicate position, the sentence topic (in
the above examples, ang kanilang kahirapan ‘their poverty’ and ang sakit ‘the pain’) normally expresses the
condition (or event) responsible for the occurrence of the action, while an actor complement (in the
examples, nila ‘them’ and ni Eddie ‘Eddie’) expresses the person(s) responsible for it.)

LF indirect—action verbs, like LF direct—action verbs (cf. §5.9), occur less often as predicates than
they do as nominalized topics. Examples of LF indirect—action verbs in sentences are:

{pinagpapaturuan
Ang iskwelang iyon ang nila sa akin.
pinapagtuturuan

‘It’s that school that they’re having me teach in.”

Iyon ang pinapangingisdaan niya sa mga bata.
‘That’s where he lets the children go fishing.”

Like their direct—action—verb counterparts (cf. §5.10), RfF indirect—action verbs are relatively few.
An example of such a verb in a sentence is:

Huwag mong papag—usapan sa kanila iyon,
‘Don’t make them talk about that.”

§5.13. Ability and involuntary—action verbs.

Derived verbs formed with the prefixes maka- and ma- (plus, in some cases, other affixes — see below)
express meanings that include the meaning of ability and/or involuntary action; these verbs may be called,
respectively, ABILITY VERBS and INVOLUNTARY -—ACTION VERBS. (For the uses of maka- and ma- as
major affixes, cf. §5.2, subsections (8) and (10).) Some speakers consistently pronounce maka- and ma- as
/maka/ and /ma/ in ability verbs, as /maka:/ and /ma:/ in involuntary—action verbs. Other speakers,
however, including most younger speakers of educated Manila Tagalog, either do not make this distinction,
or do not make it consistently. For these speakers, vowel length in the prefixes is either a matter of free
alternation or determined by the individual verb, and any derived maka- or ma- verb is potentially
ambiguous to the extent that both the ability and the involuntary—action meanings are compatible with the
central meaning of the verb. In the practice of such speakers, there is, for example, no consistent difference
in the pronunciation of the verbs in the following sentences that is correlated with the meaning difference
expressed in the two English equivalents given for the verbs:

Nakagamit siya ng manggang hilaw.
jess able )

‘He to use a green mango.”

| happened |

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 331

happened

Most verbs, whether major or derived, have ability/involuntary—action counterparts. These
counterparts are identical with the underlying verbs in focus, in the grammatical contexts in which they
occur, and, except with respect to the specific connotation of ability or involuntary action, in meaning as
well. There are regular affix correspondences between ability/involuntary—action formations and the
formations of the underlying verbs. These are summarized in Chart 16. The letter X in the chart is used to
represent the verb base plus any affix(es) that may occur in the given formation, other than the affix
specified. Thus, for example, in the formula mag- + X, X may represent a base alone, as in magbasa ‘read,’
or a prefix plus a base, as in magpadasal ‘have prayers said.’ In the goal—focus row of the chart, X
represents the verb base plus any goal—focus affix(es) other than -in. (All goal—focus affixes other than -in
are retained in ability /involuntary—action formations.)

ibili (i- + bili) ‘buy for’ > maibili
bigyan (bigay + -an) ‘give’ > mabigyan
pakiusapan (paki- + usap + -an) ‘request” > mapakiusapan

In ability and involuntary—action verbs derived from mag- verbs expressing reciprocal actions (eg.,
mag-usap ‘converse,’ magsulatan ‘write to cach other’ — cf. §5.6, class G), the regular affix, makapag-

Elements sous droits d'auteur
332 CHAPTER 5

alternates freely with the affix magka-/magka‘’}. Thus: makapag—usap ~ magka-usap ‘be able/happen to
converse,’ makapagsulatan ~ magkasulatan ‘be able/happen to write to each other.”

There are some types of verbs that do not have ability/involuntary—action counterparts. These
include:

(1) _ verbs formed with the major affixes maka- and ma-;

(2)  pluralized verb formations involving the prefix magsi- (cf. §5.15): thus there is, for example,
no *makapagsigamit corresponding to magsigamit ‘use (plural).’ (as is noted in §5.15, however,
actor—focus ability and involuntary—action verbs are themselves pluralizable by the addition of
the infix -nga-. Thus: makagamit ‘be able to use, accidentally use’ > mangakagamit ‘be able to
use (plural), accidentally use (plural).”)

(3) a number of verbs that in themselves express involuntary or non-volitional actions; these
include -um- verbs of becoming (cf. §5.6, class J); verbs of accidental result (cf. §5.16,
subsection (5)); intensive magka- + dup, verbs (cf. §5.16, subsection 1(d)), and intransitive
mang- verbs whose bases also occur as unaffixed adjectives or as ma- adjective bases (cf. §5.6,
class H). The following, for example, do not occur: “makatanda (cf. tumanda ‘grow old’);
*makapagkandasira, *makapagkansisira (cf. magkandasira, magkansisira ‘get damaged (as a
tesult)’); “snakapagkasira-sira (cf. magkasira-sira ‘get thoroughly broken’); *makapamula (cf.
mamula ‘redden’),

Ability verbs are usually translatable by the English equivalent of the underlying verb preceded by a
form of ‘be able to’ or ‘can/could.’ Perfective—aspect ability verbs are, however, often better translated by
English verbs preceded by ‘got to” or ‘managed to,” since the Tagalog verb in these cases denotes that the
ability to perform the action has been demonstrated, and that the action has actually been performed. Thus
a sentence like:

Nakapag—Hamlet si Bob.

is closer in meaning to ‘Bob got/managed to play Hamlet’ than to ‘Bob was able to play Hamlet,” since the
latter is noncommital about whether or not the action has actually been performed.

There are also contexts in which a perfective—aspect ability verb is more or less identical in meaning
with tho verb that underlies it. This is usually the case when the verb is followed by the enclitic particle na.
Thus both:

Nagamit na niya ang manggang hilaw.
and:

Ginamit na niya ang manggang hilaw.

may be translated: He has (already) used the green mango.’

Involuntary—action verbs are usually translatable by the English equivalent of the underlying verb
accompanied by some such expression as ‘accidentally,’ ‘unintentionally,’ or ‘without meaning to,” or
preceded by ‘happen(ed) to.’

In addition to the verbs presented above, which may express either ability or involuntary action,
there are certain verbs that express involuntary action alone. These verbs, which are formed with the prefix
mapa- |ma:pa/, are all actor—focus, and are derived from a limited set of intransitive and directional -um-
verbs. Some examples of correspondences between underlying and involuntary—action mapa- verbs are:

Underlying Verb Involuntary—Action mapa- Verb
dumapa ‘lie face down’ mapadapa ‘fall face down’

sumigaw ‘shout’ mapasigaw ‘shout unintentionally”
tumingin ‘look at’ mapatingin ‘look at unintentionally”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 333

There are, in addition, at least two irregular formations that express involuntary action alone. These
are:

magising /ma‘gisin/ ‘happen to wake up’
(cf. gumising /gumi‘sin/ ‘wake up’)

makatulog /ma‘katulog/ ‘happen to fall asleep’
(cf. matulog /matu:log/ ‘sleep’)

The -um- — ma- correspondence is irregular in the case of the verbs formed with gising; so also is the lack of
vowel length in the bases of both derived verbs, as compared with the bases of their major~verb
counterparts.

§5.14. Social verbs.

Derived verbs formed with the prefix maki- (plus; in some cases, other affixes — see below) express
actions that are performed together with another person or other people; these verbs may be called
SOCIAL VERBS. All social verbs are actor—focus, selecting as topic the performer(s) of the action denoted
by the verb; a sa phrase is used to express the one(s) together with whom the action is performed. For
example, in the sentence:

Nakikikain ng hapunan si Ben sa Nanay.
‘Ben is eating supper with Mother.’

the performer of the action is expressed by si Ben, the person together with whom the action is performed,
by sa Nanay.

Social verbs are derived from other AF verbs, major and derived. A sentence with a social verb in the
predicate may be said to be derived from a sentence with the underlying non-social verb in the predicate,
and with a coordinate nominal topic (cf. §3.10). The derivation involves the replacement of one of the
coordinate nominals with a sa phrase. Thus the sentence Nakikikain ng hapunan si Ben sa Nanay may be
said to be derived from:

Kumakain ng hapunan si Ben at ang Nanay.
‘Ben and Mother are eating supper.”

Note that any complement(s) accepted by the underlying verb (such as ng Aapunan in the example) are also
accepted by the social verb.

On the basis of both meaning and rules of formation, social verbs may be divided into two
subclasses: SIMPLE SOCIAL VERBS AND RECIPROCAL SOCIAL VERBS. Simple social verbs may be
derived from ma-, -um, mag-, magpa- (indirect action — cf. §5.12, subsection (1)) or mang- verbs. (The mag-
verbs from which simple social verbs are derived are those that do not express reciprocal action. Of the -uz-
and ma- verbs, only those expressing voluntary actions have social verb counterparts.) The affix
correspondences between the underlying and derived verbs are shown in Chart 17.

(d) magpadala ‘send’ makipagpadala ‘share in the sending of”
magpagawa ‘get (something) done” makipagpagawa ‘share in getting
something done’
(e) mamili (base: bili) ‘go shopping’ makipamili ‘go shopping with, share
in the shopping activities of”
mangisda ‘go fishing’ makipangisda ‘go fishing with, share

in the fishing activities of

Note that simple social verbs derived from mag- verbs may be formed with either maki- or makipag. The
maki- formation is preferred in most cases.

As the English translations with ‘share (in)’ indicate, simple social verbs often carry the implication
that the performer (expressed by the sentence topic is taking part in an activity in which another person
(expressed by the sa phrase) has, in some sense, a prior or more direct involvement. Some pertinent
illustrations are:

Uminom sila ng alak; nakiinom ako sa kanila.
‘They drank wine; I drank along with them.”

Napag-alaman ko ang pagkamatay ng inyong ama; nakikidalamhati ako sa inyo.
‘I heard about your father’s death; I share in your grief.’

Reciprocal social verbs are derived from intransitive mag- verbs that express reciprocal actions (cf.
§5.6, class G). The reciprocal social verbs are formed by replacing the mag- of the underlying verb with
makipag-. Examples are:

Underlying Verb Reciprocal Social Verb

magbigayan ‘exchange gifts” makipagbigayan ‘exchange gifts with’
magbuntalan ‘exchange blows’ makipagbuntalan ‘exchange blows with’
magkamay ‘exchange handshakes’ makipagkamay ‘shake hands with’
maghiwalay ‘separate’ makipaghiwalay ‘separate from’
magsagutan ‘quarrel’ makipagsagutan ‘quarrel with’
mag-usap ‘converse’ makipag-usap ‘converse with’

Note that, while simple social verbs derived from mag- verbs are formed with either maki--or makipag-,
reciprocal social verbs derived from mag- verbs are always formed with makipag-.

§5.15. Pluralized verbs.

In English there is often an obligatory distinction between the form of a verb occurring with a
singular subject and that of a verb occurring with a plural subject: thus, ‘He sings’ vs. ‘They sing.’ There are
also, however, many cases in which the forms of verbs occurring with singular and plural subjects are not
distinguished: e.g., ‘He/they sang,’ ‘He/They can sing,’ etc. In Tagalog there is never any obligatory

Elements sous droits d'auteur
‘VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 335

distinction between the forms of verbs occurring with singular and plural topics: thus, Kumakanta siya/sila
‘He sings’/’They sing.’ In the case of all actor—focus verbs, however, regardless of aspect, Tagalog allows of
an optional PLURALIZED VERB formation that occurs only with a plural topic. Thus the pluralized verb
magsikanta ‘sing (pl.)’ (imperfective form: nagsisikanta) may occur with a topic like sila ~ Nagsisikanta sila
‘They sing’ — but not with a topic like siya: There is no *Nagsisikanta siya.

Pluralized verb formations include either or both the prefix magsi- and the infix -nga-. Magsi- occurs
in the pluralized counterparts of -um-, mag-, ang mang: verbs. It also occurs in the pluralized counterparts
of derived verbs formed with affixes that include mag-. The correspondences between the underlying and
pluralized affixes are shown in Chart 18.

magpalinis ‘permit/cause to clean’ magsipagpalinis ‘permit/cause to clean (pl.)’
mangailangan ‘need’ magsipangailangan ‘need (pl.)'
mangisda ‘go fishing’ magsipangisda ‘go fishing (pl.)’

The infix -nga- may occur in a pluralized formation corresponding to any underlying AF formation
that includes a prefix, other than mang-, beginning with /m/. Thus -nga- may occur in pluralized formations
corresponding to AF ma- verbs, to major or derived verbs that include maXe-, and to major or derived verbs
that include mag-. In this last group are included pluralized formations with magsi-, magsipag-, and
magsipang-. The addition of -nga- to such pluralized formations does not affect the meaning. In all the
formations in which it occurs, -nga- is added immediately after the first consonant and vowel of the prefix.
Examples are:

Underlying Verb Pluralized (-nga-) Verb
mabulok ‘get rotten’ mangabulok ‘get rotten (pl.)’
mawala ‘disappear’ mangawala ‘disappear (p).)"
makakita ‘see’ mangakakita ‘see (pl.)’

magsikanta ‘sing (pl.)’ mangagsikanta ‘sing (pl.)”
magsipangisda ‘go fishing (pl.)’ mangagsipangisda ‘go fishing (pl.)”

§5.16. Other derived verbs.

This section presents various types of derived verbs not dealt with in previous sections. The
presentation of these derived—verb types is preceded by an explanation of certain symbols used in
identifying some of the formations to be discussed. These symbols are: dup, -, dup,-, and (-L).

Dup,- and dup,- represent duplicating prefixes, respectively monosyllabic and disyllabic. The
formation of dup,- is presented in detail in §3.7. (Dup,- occurs in derived—noun, as well as in
derived—verb, formations.) As is noted in that section, dup, - normally consists of a duplication of the first
consonant and first vowel of the syllable before which it occurs, except that the vowel of dup, - is always
short. (Often it is vowel length that distinguishes dup,- from the aspectual—duplication prefix, dup,-,
whose formation is presented in detail in §5.19. As is noted in that section, the vowel of dup a7 is always
long. Compare: maglalakbay /maglalakbay/ ‘travel (repeatedly, etc.)’ (the basic form of a derived verb) and
maglalakbay /magla‘lakbay/ ‘will travel’ (the contemplated form of a major verb).)

Dup,- normally consists of a duplication of the first two syllables of the base before which it occurs,
except that: (1) before a base that has more than two syllables, the vowel of the second syllable of dup; - is
always long, whether the vowel of the second syllable of the base is long or short, and any final consonant

of this syllable is lost in dup3-; (2) before a disyllabic base that has undergone length shift as a result of
suffixation (cf. §1.12), both vowels of dup,- are short; (3) before a base and suffix coalesced into two

syllables (e.g., tingnan /tinnan/ ‘look at,’ an irregular formation consisting of the base singin and the suffix
-an), dup2- consists of a duplication of these two syllables. (The usual automatic consonant and vowel
changes that characterize forms in medial position also occur in the case of dup,-: ¢.g., replacement of /o/
by /u/, loss of syllable—final /h/, replacement of syllable—final /’/ by vowel length.)

(-L) represents the absence of penultimate vowel length in the formation. The loss of penultimate
vowel length in the verb base is characteristic of a number of types of derived verbs. For example, the
formation of intensive mag- verbs (cf. subsection (1.a), below) may be stated formulaically as follows:

-um- + Base > mag- + Base (-L)

That is, intensive mag- verbs are derived from -wm- verbs by: (1) the replacement of -wm- by mag-; (2) the
shortening of the penultimate vowel of the base, if this is long in the -wm- verb. Thus: damakad /luma*kad/
‘walk’ > maglakad /maglakad/ ‘walk (repeatedly, etc.).’ There are also cases in which the syllable affected
by (-L) is the last syllable of the base, when this is followed by a suffix. Compare, for example, the derived
verb pagtatapakan /pagtatapakan/ ‘step on (repeatedly, etc.),’ which shows (-L), and the major verb from
which it is derived, tapakan /tapa:kan/ ‘step on’ (cf. subsection (1.b), below).

When dup,- precedes a base that shows (-L), it too lacks penultimate vowel length. Note, for
example, the absence of vowel length in the second syllable of maglakad-lakad /maglakadjakad/} ‘do a little
walking.’ (Maglakad-lakad is a moderative verb derived from Aumakad fluma‘kad/. The formation of the
moderative verb may be summarized: mag- + dup, - + Base (-L) — cf. subsection (2.a), below.)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 337

The various types of desived verbs to be discussed are presented below in the following order: (1)
intensive verbs; (2) moderative verbs; (3) relational verbs; (4) multiple reciprocal and relational verbs; (5)
verbs of accidental result; (6) derived mang- verbs. Unless otherwise specified, the derived verbs are identical
in focus and complement class with the verbs from which iey are derived.

(1) INTENSIVE VERBS. Five types of intensive—verb formations may be distinguished, according to
the affixes that characterize the formations: (a) intensive mag- verbs; (b) intensive mag- + dup,- and
pag- + dup,- verbs; (c) intensive mmag-...-um- verbs; (d) intensive magka- + dup2- verbs; (e) intensive
magpaka- (+ dup3-) verbs.

(a) Intensive mag- verbs express frequent, prolonged, or purposeful performance of an activity. They
are derived from certain -um- verbs, according to the formula:

-um- + Base > — mag- + Base (-L)

(See the explanation of (-L) above.) Some examples are:

«um- Verb Intensive mag- Verb

kumain /kuma‘‘in/ ‘eat’ magkain /magka’in/ ‘eat (repeatedly, etc.)”
lumakad /luma*kad/ ‘walk’ maglakad /maglakad/ ‘walk (repeatedly, etc.)’
tumawa /tuma‘wah/ ‘laugh’ magtawa /magtawah/ ‘laugh (repeatedly, etc.)’

(All of the -um- verbs from which intensive smag- verbs may be derived have bases with penultimate vowel
length.)

(b) Intensive mag- + dup,- and pag- + dup,- verbs have the same connotation as intensive mag- verbs
(cf. (1.a), above), but suggest a somewhat greater degree of frequency, etc., of activity than do the mag-
verbs. They are derived from certain major actor—focus verbs formed with the affixes -wm-, mag-, ma-, and
mang-, and certain major goal-focus verbs formed with the affixes -an, -in and i. The relation of the
intensive formations to those of the underlying verbs is shown in Chart 19. The symbol B in the chart

(d) Intensive magka: {magka:/ # dup, verbs are derived froin certain intransilive ima- and mag- verbs.
(Underlying sa- verbs are generally verbs of ‘becoming’ — cf. §5.6, class D.) The intensive verbs express the
thorough attainment of the state, etc., expressed by the underlying verb. The relation between the
formation of the underlying and derived verbs is shown in the following formula:

ma-
+ Base ~ magka- + dup, - + Base (-L)
mag-

Some examples are:

Underlying Verb Intensive magka- (+ dupg-) Verb

mabasag /maba‘sag/ magkabasag-basag /magka‘ basagbasag/

‘get broken’ ‘get thoroughly broken’

masira /masi-ra’/ magkasira-sira /magka‘sira’sira’}

‘separate from one another’ ‘get thoroughly separated from one another’
magsugat /magsu’gat/ magkasugat-sugat /magka‘sugatsugat/

‘have sores, get a wound” ‘be thoroughly covered with sores or wounds.’

(At least one magka- + dup,- verb, magkahalu-halo {magka‘ha‘lu‘ha-lo’} ‘get thoroughly mixed together’
(cf. maghalo {magha‘lo’} ‘get mixed together’) — does not show loss of penultimate vowel length.) (Most of
the duplicated formations that occur in intensive magka- + dup,- verbs also <ccr as intensive
adjectives — cf. §4.12.)

(e) Intensive magpaka- (+ dup3-) verbs are derived from certain ma- and -um- verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf.
§5.6, classes D and J). They express the deliberate effort to attain, in a high degree, the quality expressed
by the verb base. (The verbal prefix magpaka- is probably related to the adjectival prefix napaka- that
occurs in intensified adjectives — cf. §4.12.) Formations that include dup2- express the effort to attain a
relatively higher degree of the pertinent quality than do those that Jack dup,-. Magpaka- has a long final
vowel when followed by dup.; the final vowel is short otherwise; compare, for example: magpakabait-bait
{magpaka‘ba’itba’it/ and magpakabait |magpakaba‘it/ ‘(try to) be very kind, good.’ The relation between
the formation of the underlying and derived verbs is shown in the following formula:

ma-
+ Base + magpaka- (+ dup, -) + Base

Some examples are:

magutom magpaka(gutom-)gutom

yuraman magpaka(yaman-)yaman

(2) MODERATIVE VERBS. Moderative verbs express activities performed perfunctorily,
occasionally, at random, etc. They are often equivalent to English verbs accompanied by such phrases as ‘a
little,” ‘a bit,’ ‘now and then,” ‘here and there,’ etc. One of their most common uses is to soften a request, as
in:

Magwalis-walis ka nga ng bakuran.
‘Please sweep the yard a little.”

(cf. Magwalis ka nga ng bakuran,
‘Please sweep the yard.”)

Two types of moderative verbs may be distinguished: (a) moderative mag- + dup,- verbs; (b) moderative
dup,- verbs. They are presented in turn below.

(a) Moderative mag- +dup,- verbs are derived from certain -wm- verbs in accordance with the
following formula:

-um- + Base > mag- + dup, - + Base (-L)

Examples are:
-um- Verb Moderative mag- + dupg Verb
humanap /huma:nap/ maghanap-hanap /maghanaphanap/
‘search for’ ‘do a little searching for’
lumakad /luma-kad/ maglakad-lakad /maglakadlakad/
‘walk’ ‘do a little walking’
umisip /"umi-sip/ mag-isip-isip /mag’isip’isip/
‘think’ ‘do a little thinking’

(Apparently all of the -wn- verbs from which moderative mag- + dupg- verbs may be derived have bases
with penultimate vowel length.)

(b) Moderative dup,- verbs are formed by adding dup 2- to certain major verbs formed with the
actor—focus affixes ma-, mag-, mang-, and -um- or the goal—focus affixes -an, +, and -in. Penultimate vowel
length in the base is optionally but preferably deleted. Some examples of correspondences between
underlying and moderative dup,- verbs are:

Underlying Verb Moderative dup;- Verb
mahiya /mahiya’/ mahiya-hiya /mahiya:hiya’/
‘be ashamed’ ‘be a little ashamed’
{mag’a'yus’a‘yos/
mag-ayos /mag’a‘yos/ mag-ayos-ayos
{mag’ayus’ayus/
‘put in order’ ‘put in order a little”
magwalis /magwalis/ magwalis-walis /magwaliswalis/
‘sweep* ‘sweep a little’
mamula /mamulah/ mamula-mula /mamulamulah/
‘tedden’ ‘redden a little’
Pumu-run’u'ron}
umurong j*umu‘ron/ umurung-urong
fumurun’uron!
‘go back’ “go back a little”

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 341

Underlying Verb Moderative dup, - Verb
tingnan /tinnan/ tingnan-tingnan /tinnantinnan/
‘look at’ ‘look at a little’

fi'u'run’u'ron!

iurong {’i’u'ron! iurung-urong

Piurun’uron}
‘move back’ ‘move back a little”

/Minislini-sin/
linisin flini-sin/ linis-linisin

flinislinisin/
‘clean’ ‘clean a little”

(There is a subclass of moderative dup,- verbs related in form and meaning to intermittent—activity
adjectives of the shape pa- + dup,- + base. The verbs in this subclass are all directional -umn- verbs. Examples
are given in §4.7.)

(3) RELATIONAL VERBS. Relational verbs express actions that establish a relation shared by two or
more objects. They are derived from certain major object—focus verbs belonging to the double—object—verb
complement class. The major affix, in all cases #, is replaced in the relational verb by the affix pag-..-in.
Thus, for example, the relational verb that corresponds to the major verb isa¢na ‘put in with’ is pagsamahin
‘put together.’ Relational verbs do not take the directional complements taken by the underlying verbs.
Instead, they take topics that express two or more objects. Compare, for example, the following two
sentences, which have in predicate position the relational verb pagsamahin and the underlying
double—object verb isama respectively:

Pagsamahin mo ang karne at gulay.
‘Put the meat and the vegetables together.’

Isama mo ang karne sa gulay.
‘Put the meat in with the vegetables.’

Some further examples of correspondences between underlying and relational verbs are:

Underlying Verb Relational Verb

idugtong ‘join to’ pagdugtungin ‘join together’
idikit ‘stick/paste onto’ pagdikitin ‘stick/paste together’
ilapit ‘put near’ paglapitin ‘put near one another’

(4) MULTIPLE RECIPROCAL AND RELATIONAL VERBS. Multiple reciprocal verbs are derived
from certain intransitive mag- erbs (cf. §5.6, class G); the mag- verbs from which the multiple reciprocal
verbs are derived are those that express reciprocal actions, and whose bases do not include the suffix -an.
(Mag- verbs that express reciprocal action, but whose bases do include the suffix -an — e.g., magkamayan
‘exchange handshakes’ — do not occur as the source of multiple reciprocal verbs.) Multiple relational verbs

are derived from relational verbs (cf. subsection (3), above).
Multiple reciprocal verbs express reciprocal actions involving more than two actors: ¢.g.,

j sina Rosa, Nene, at Fely.
Nagkita-kita
l sila.

‘Rosa, Nene, and Fely
saw one another.”
‘They (more than two)

Multiple relational verbs express actions that establish a relation shared by more than two objects: ¢.g.,

j tatlong )
Pinagdugtung-dugtong ko ang tali.
l limang {
{ three
‘I joined the pieces of string together.’
five

Multiple reciprocal and relational verbs are formed by adding dup- to the underlying verbs.
Examples are:

Underlying Verb Multiple Verb

magkita ‘see one another magkita-kita ‘see one another (more
(two or more actors)’ than two actors)’

maghiwalay ‘separate from one maghiwa-hiwalay ‘separate from one
another (two or more actors)’ another (more than two actors)”
mag-usap ‘converse (two mag-usap-usap ‘converse (more than
or more actors)” two actors)’

pagdugtungin ‘join (two pagdugtung-dugtungin ‘join (more
or more objects) together’ than two objects) together’
pagdikitin ‘stick/paste pagdikit-dikitin ‘stick/paste (more
(two or more objects) together’ than two objects) together’
pagtabihin ‘put (two or pagtabi-tabihin ‘put (more than
more objects) beside one another’ two objects) beside one another’

(5) VERBS OF ACCIDENTAL RESULT. Certain verbs derived from intransitive ma- verbs (or, ina
few cases, intransitive -ws- verbs) express events viewed as accidents or involuntary acts resulting from
conditions expressed in the preceding linguistic context. The use of such verbs generally suggests censure,
the implication being ‘It need not have happened.’ One example is:

nagkanghuhulog
Itinulak niya ako; tuloy ang mga dala ko.
nagkandahulog

‘He pushed me; asa result, the things I was carrying fell down.”

In verbs of accidental result, the major affix is replaced either by magkang-+dup,- or by
magkanda-: ¢.g., mahulog ‘fall’ -> magkanghuhulog ~ magkandahulog ‘fall accidentally (as a result).’ The
two affixes are generally in free alternation. (Magkang- has one of three forms: magkam- /magkam/ if the
following consonant is labial; magkan /magkan/ if the following consonant is dental or alveolar; magkang-
/magkan/ in other cases.) Further examples of the correspondence between underlying verbs and verbs of
accidental result are:

magkandawala j
magkang-iiyak

(6) DERIVED mang- VERBS. Derived mang- verbs are formed from certain major transitive -um-
and (in a few cases) mag- verbs by replacement of the major affix with mang-. The mang- verbs express the
basic meaning of the underlying major verb plus some additional clement of meaning. This additional
element is normally either: (a) deliberately harmful or destructive activity; or (b) activity directed toward
multiple objects. In a few cases, the additional element of meaning is: (c) intensive or repeated activity
directed toward a single object. Some examples of the correspondence between underlying verbs and

derived mang- verbs are:

Underlying Verb
(a) kumain ‘eat’

sumugat ‘wound’

tumaga ‘cut?

magwalis ‘sweep, use a broom’

(b) kumuha ‘get’
pumitas ‘pick’

tumahi ‘sew’

tumakot ‘frighten’
(c) dumikit ‘get stuck to’

sumuyo ‘curry favor with’

umibig ‘love’

Derived mang: Verb
mangain ‘devour (applied especially
to man-eating or predatory animals)’

manugat ‘wound (deliberately)"

managa ‘slash (with intent to hurt
or destroy)’

mangwalis ‘hit with a broom’
manguha ‘gather’
mamitas ‘pick (a number of things)’

manahi ‘sew (a number of things,

manakot ‘frighten (a number of people)’
manikit ‘get thoroughly stuck to’
manuyo ‘curry favor with (repeatedly):

mangibig ‘pay court to”

§5.17. Inventory of verbal affixes.

The various verbal affixes presented in § §5.2 through 5.16 are listed below in alphabetical order. The
following notes pertain to the listing:

(1) & is the third letter of the Tagalog alphabet; therefore, for example, maka- precedes mag-;

(2) the symbols + and ...do not affect the alphabeticization; therefore, for example, i- + dup- is
alphabetized as it is began with id, and pag-...-an as it it were pagan;

(3) the prefix dup, - precedes the prefix dup, -;

(4) verbs formed with prefixes listed as ending in ng- (e.g., mang-) may show assimilatory changes
either in the prefix alone or in both the prefix and the base, according to conditions that are summarized in
§5.2, subsection (12);

(5) verbs formed with prefixes listed as ending in ng'- (e.g., magkang'-) may show assimilatory
changes in the prefix (but not in the base), according to conditions that are summarized in the sections in
which these prefixes are presented.

Each listed affix is followed by one or more examples of basic forms in which it occurs. One example
is presented for each different verb type that involves the affix. The examples are in most cases preceded by
symbols representing the focus of the verb (see below for exceptions). The symbols used are:

AF actor—focus IF instrumental—focus
A2F secondary—actor—focus LF locative—focus

BF benefactive—focus MF measurement—focus
CF causative—focus OF object—focus

DF directional—focus RF reservational—focus
RIF referential—focus

In the case of major transitive verbs, the symbols representing the focus of the verb are immediately
followed by symbols in parentheses representing the verb’s complement class. (Where an affix occurs in
major verbs representing two or more complement classes, each of these classes is exemplified.) The
symbols used to represent complement classes are:

D directional verb
DO double—object verb
oO object verb

In the listing of major intransitive verbs, a distinction is made between, on the one hand,
simple—intransitive and adjunctive verbs and, on the other,pseudo—transitive and adjunctive—pseudo—
transitive verbs (cf. §5.6). The simple—intransitive and adjunctive verbs are listed as AF(I): that is, actor—
focus intransitive. The pseudo—transitive and adjunctive—pscudo-transitive verbs are preceded by the
symbols PT, no focus being specified.

In the listing of derived verbs, the symbols representing the focus of the verb are immediately
followed by symbols in parentheses representing the type of derived verb illustrated (cf. §§5.12 through
5.16). The symbols used are:

a ability—involuntary—action verb
ar _verb of accidental result
d derived mang- verb, or AF verb derived from a derived mang- verb
i intensive verb
ja _indirect—action verb
in involuntary—action verb
m_—__moderative verb
mr = multiple—reciprocal or multiple—relational verb
p ___ pluralized verb with one pluralizing affix component
P2 _ pluralized verb with two pluralizing affix components
t relational verb
social verb

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

345

Where two or more different types of derived verbs are simultaneously represented in a single formation,
two or more of the above symbols are used, separated by commas. For example, the notation AF(a,ja,p)

denotes the ability—involuntary—action form of a pluralized indirect—action actor—focus verb.

Each basic form is followed by an English translation. In the case of ability—involuntary—action verbs
(cf. §5.13), only the ‘ability’ meaning is shown in the translation. The translation of all pluralized verbs (cf.
§5.15) include the symbol p in parentheses; this is to be understood as signifying that the verb requires a
plural topic. The translations of certain intensive verbs (cf. $5.16, subsection (1)) include the symbol i in
parentheses; this is to be understood as signifying that the verbs connote actions performed, repeatedly,

frequently, intensively, etc.

§5.18. Base formations.

On the basis of their internal structure, Tagalog verb bases may be divided into the following
classes: (1) SIMPLE BASES; (2) DERIVED BASES; (3) COMPOUND BASES; (4) PHRASAL BASES;
These classes are presented in turn below.

(1) SIMPLE BASES. Simple bases are those that consist of only one meaningful element. The
majority of simple bases also occur as independent words and/or as bases of formations not derived from
verbs (¢.g., as ma- adjective bases — cf. §4,3); a smaller number occurs only in verbs and in formations
derived from verbs (e.g., gerunds — cf. §3.26). The following further points may be noted:

(a) Various subclasses of simple bases may be identified on the basis of the occurrence of the
members of the subclasses with particular verbal affixes, and of the similarity of the members of the
subclasses with respect to meaning or distribution. For example, there is a subclass of simple bases that
occur independently as unmarked nouns designating articles of clothing, and that serve as the bases of
intransitive mag- verbs (cf. §5.6, class G) expressing the wearing of these articles of clothing: e.g., kurbata
‘tie,’ in magkurbata ‘wear a tie’; tsinelas ‘slippers,” in magtsinelas ‘wear slippers.’ Similarly, there is a

Elements sous droits d'auteur
356 CHAPTER 5

subclass of simple bases that occur in ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3), and that serve as the bases of -um- verbs of
‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6, class J): ¢.g., ganda ‘beauty,’ in gumanda ‘become beautiful’ (cf. maganda
‘beautiful’); Airap ‘difficulty,’ in humirap ‘become difficult’ (cf. mahirap ‘difficult’), (Various other such
subclasses are noted in connection with the presentation of the major affixes and verb classes in § §5.2
through 5.6).

(b) Most of the bases that occur only in verbs and in formations derived from verbs form intransitive
mang- verbs (cf. §5.6, class H). Examples are:

-mitig in mamitig ‘feel numb’ (cf. pamimitig ‘feeling numb’)
-nibugho in manibugho ‘become jealous’ (cf. paninibugho ‘becoming jealous’)
nganay in manganay ‘deliver one’s first child’ (cf. panganganay ‘delivering

one’s first child’)

(Bases that never occur word-—initially are written with a preceding hyphen.) At least one such base occurs
in an intransitive ma- verb: -matay in mamatay ‘die’ (cf. pagkamatay ‘dying’); and at least one occurs in
cach of the ma-/-ipa, ma/-ma-.. . -an and mang-/pang- . . . -in object verb classes (cf. §5.3, classes A.1, A.2,
and D.5):

-ligo in maligo/ipaligo ‘bathe with’.
-tuto in matuto/matutuhan ‘learn’
-nood in mannod/panoorin ‘watch’ (cf. panonood ‘watching’)

(c) Many simple bases occur in irregular verb formations (cf. §5.24).

(d) The interrogative word ano ‘what’ can occur with almost any verbal affix to form interrogative
verbs (cf. §7.8).

Some further examples of simple verb bases are:

alinlangan ‘doubt’ in mag-alinlangan/pag-alinlanganan ‘doubt’
anawnser ‘announcer’ in mag-anawnser ‘be an announcer’

(Borrowed bases that are analyzable into two or more elements in the language of origin, but that
function as unanalyzable units in Tagalog, are classified as simpl!c.)

asikaso ‘manage’ in mag-asikaso/asikasuhin ‘manage; take care of?

araw ‘sun, day” in umaraw ‘be day, be sunshine’

aray ‘ouch!’ in umaray ‘say “ouch” ’

asawa ‘spouse’ in mag-asawa ‘get married’

bagabag ‘worry’ in bumagabay/bagabagin ‘worry’

balahibo “‘feather(s)’ in magbalahibo/balahibuhan ‘remove the feathers of

baluktot ‘bent’ in bumaluktot ‘bend (oneself)’; magbaluktot/baluktutin ‘bend (an object)’; ibaluktot
‘put in a bent position’

bigay ‘gift’ in magbigay/ibigay/bigyan ‘give’

kuha ‘get’ in kumuha/kunin/kunan ‘get’

dahilan ‘cause’ in magdahilan ‘give an excuse’

Disyembre ‘December’ in mag-Disyembre ‘be December’

diri ‘disgust’ in mandiri/pandirihan ‘be disgusted with’

dugo ‘blood’ in magdugo ‘bleed’

gulumihanan ‘confusion’ in magulumihanan ‘get confused’

hagulgol ‘sob’ in humagulgol ‘sob’

hinagpis ‘grief in maghinagpis ‘grieve’

hiwalay ‘separate’ in maghiwalay ‘separate (from each other)’; humiwalay/hiwalayan ‘be separated
from’

ingat ‘care’ in mag-ingat/pag-ingatan ‘be careful of

martsa ‘march’ in magmartsa ‘march’

mina ‘mine’ in magmina/minahin ‘mine’

payat ‘thin’ in pumayat ‘get thin’

plantsa ‘flatiron’ in magplantsa/plantsahin ‘press with a flatiron)’

pili ‘choice’ in pumili/piliin ‘choose’

sipon ‘head cold’ in sipunin ‘be afflicted with a head cold’

telegrama ‘telegram’ in tumelegrama/telegramahan ‘send a telegram to’
tuka ‘bill’ in tumuka/tukain ‘peck’

usap ‘talk’ in mag-usap ‘talk’

(2) DERIVED BASES. Derived bases consist of a simple base plus one or more affixes. In most cases
the derived base also occurs as a derived noun or adjective (cf. §§3.7 and 4.3 through 4.10); in a few cases
the derived base occurs only in verbs and related formations.

(a) Derived nouns serving as verb bases. Some examples of derived nouns that occur as verb bases are:

bahay-bahayan ‘doll house/house (the game)" in magbahay-bahayan ‘play house’ (cf. bahay ‘house’)

bigayan ‘act of giving one another’ in magbigayan ‘give one another’ (cf. bigay ‘gift’)

bulung-bulungan ‘repeated whispers to one another, gossip’ in magbulung-bulungan ‘whisper
repeatedly to one another, gossip’ (cf. bulong ‘whisper’)

kahulugan ‘meaning’ in mangahulugan ‘mean’ (cf. hulog ‘fall’)

katwiran ‘reason’ in mangatwiran ‘reason out’ (cf. tuwid ‘straight’)

higanti ‘revenge’ in maghiganti/paghigantihan ‘seck revenge’ (cf. ganti ‘return, reward’)

himutok ‘sigh’ in maghimutok ‘sigh’ (cf. putok ‘explosion’)

hinanakit ‘hurt feelings’ in maghinanakit/paghinanaktan ‘feel hurt by’ (cf. sakit ‘pain’)

pagandahan ‘beauty contest’ in magpagandahan ‘compete in a beauty contest’ (cf. ganda ‘beauty’)

patayan ‘killing one another’ in magpatayan ‘kill one another’ (cf. patay ‘dead”)

pari-parian ‘pretense of being a priest’ in magpari-parian ‘pretend to be a priest’ (cf. pari ‘priest’)

tag-araw ‘hot season’ in magtag-araw ‘be the beginning of the hot season’ (ef. araw ‘sun’)

tag-ulan ‘rainy season’ in magtag-ulan ‘be the beginning of the rainy season’ (cf. ulan ‘rain’)

tirahan ‘place of residence’ in manirahan ‘have one’s residence (in)’ (cf. tumira ‘reside’)

(Certain of the derived—noun formations illustrated above —

e.g., those that begin with /i- — are not presented in §3.7, since the formation—type is relatively rare, and
§3.7 is concerned primarily with the more productive derived—noun classes.)

(b) Derived adjectives serving as verb bases. Derived adjectives of various types occur as verb bases,
among them: (b.1) ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3); (b.2) ordinal numbers and distributive and grouping numerals
(cf. §§4.4 and 4.5); (6.3) pa0- intermittent—activity adjectives (cf. §4.7; (b.4) pang- reservational and
instrumental adjectives (cf. §4.5); (b.S) ma-...-an adjectives (cf. §4.10, subsection (5)). The pang-
adjectives form reservational—focus and instrumental—focus verbs with the prefix é- (cf. §5.11). The other
types of derived adjectives all occur with the prefix mag-, forming, in the case of ma- adjectives, either
intransitive mag- verbs (cf. §5.6, class G) or mag-/pag-... -an directional verbs (cf. §5.4, class B.2), and
forming in the other cases intransitive smag- verbs only.

(b.1) Verbs in which ma- adjectives occur as bases express the pretended or deliberate assumption of
the quality expressed by the adjective. Examples are:

mabait ‘kind’ in magmabait/pagmabaitan ‘pretend to be kind to’
madali ‘fast’ in magmadali ‘hurry’
marunong ‘wise’ in magmarunong ‘pretend to be wise’

A long penultimate vowel in the adjective is shortened in the verb: compare marunong /maru:non/ and
magmarunong /magmarunon!.

(b.2) Ordinal numbers formed with ika- occur in mag- verbs expressing clock time and dates. The
verbs are inflectable only for the contemplated aspect (cf. §5.19). The same ng phrases that occur after the

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
358 : CHAPTER 5

ordinal numbers (cf. §4.4, subsections (6) and (2)) occur as adjuncts after the verbs (cf. §5.26). Examples
are:

ikalabindalawa (ng tanghali) ‘twelve o’clock (noon)’ in mag-ikalabindalawa
(ng tanghali) *be twelve o’clock (noon)’

ikatatlumpu (ng Disyembre) ‘the thirtieth (of December)’ in mag-ikatatlumpu
(ng Disyembre) ‘be the thirtieth (of December)’

Mag- verbs with distributive numerals serving as bases take as adjunts the same ng phrases or
constructions introduced by na/-ng as are taken by the numerals (cf. §4.5, subsection (a)), Examples are:

tigi-tigisa (nito) ‘one cach (of these)’ in magtigi-tigisa (nito) ‘take one each (of these)’
tiga-tigalawa(ng piraso ng kendi) ‘one (piece) each (of the candy)’ in magtiga-tigalawa(ng piraso ng
kendi) ‘take one (piece) each (of the candy)’

Examples of grouping numerals serving as verb bases are:

dala-dalawa ‘by twos, in pairs’ in magdala-dalawa ‘go/be in pairs’
lima-lima ‘by fives, in groups of five’ in maglima-lima ‘go/be in groups of five’

(b.3) Examples of pa- intermittent-activity adjectives serving as verb bases are:

pabalik-balik ‘going back and forth’ in magpabalik-balik ‘go back and forth’
palipad-lipad ‘flying intermittently’ in magpalipad-lipad ‘fly intermittently’

(b.4) Examples of pang- adjectives serving as bases of reservational—focus and instrumental—focus /-
verbs are:

pambahan ‘for use/wear in the house’ in ipambahay ‘use/wear in the house’
pambili ‘for buying’ in ipambili ‘buy with’

pampanood ‘for watching’ in ipampanood ‘watch with’

pangkape ‘for use in coffee’ in ipangkape ‘use in coffee”

(b.5) Examples of ma-. .. -an adjectives serving as verb bases are:

mahigpitan ‘close (in fighting)’ in magmahigpitan ‘be close (in fighting)’
matagalan ‘prolonged’ in magmatagalan ‘be prolonged’

(c) Other derived bases. Derived bases that occur only in verbs and related formations (such as
gerunds) consist of a single base preceded by ki-, maka-, paka-, or sa-. Except for the bases that include Ki-

(see below), all occur in intransitive mag- verbs (cf. §5.6, class G).
({c.1) Bases that include the prefix ké occur in the ma-/pa-...-an directional—verb class — cf. the

discussion under class A.3, §5.4. Examples are:
-kibagay in makibagay/pakibagayan ‘adapt oneself to’ (cf. bagay ‘suitable’)
-kiisa in makiisa/pakiisahan ‘cooperate with’ (cf. isa ‘one’)
-kiramdam in makiramdam/pakiramdaman ‘observe secretly’ (cf. damdam ‘feeling’)

(c.2) Maka- occurs in a very few derived bases. Examples are:

-makaamo in magmakaamo ‘be very docile’ (cf. -amo in maamo ‘docile’)
-makaawa in magmakaawa ‘beseech mercy’ (cf. awa ‘mercy’)

(c.3) In most cases, verbs in which mag- is followed by paka- plus a simple base are regarded as
intensive magpaka- verbs (cf. §5.16, subsection (1.¢)), derived from mia- or -unt verbs of ‘becoming’. Ina

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 333

few cases, however, there is no underlying sma or -um- verb, and the paka- may most simply be regarded as
part of a derived base. Examples are:

-pakasakit in magpakasakit/magpakasa:kit/ ‘make a sacrifice’ (cf. sakit /sakit/ ‘pain’ (vowel length
added in verb base))
-pakatao in magpakatao ‘act in a civilized manner’ (cf. tao ‘human being’)

(c.4) In most cases, sa- occurring as part of a verb base is related to the sa that marks locative and
possessive phrases, and the base is regarded as a phrasal base (see (4), below). There is, however, a set of
bases that include sa- and that are apparently unrelated to phrases. These bases consist of sa- plus a noun
that designates a person or animal. The verbs in which the bases occur express the assumption of the
behavior of the person or animal denoted by the noun. Examples are:

-sa-Kastila in magsa-Kastila ‘behave like a Spaniard (cf. Kastila ‘Spaniard’)
-sa-Hamlet in magsa-Hamlet ‘behave like Hamlet’ (cf. Hamlet ‘Hamlet’)
-sa-pagong in magsa-pagong ‘behave like a turtle’ (cf. pagong ‘turtle’)

(3) COMPOUND BASES. These bases consist of two simple bases (or, in a few cases, one simple base
and one derived base) joined by the linker -ng (which, according to the context, shows either the form /n/
or a zero form — cf. §3.8). Most compound bases also occur independently as nominal or adjectival
compounds. (Nominal compounds are presented in §3.8. As is noted in that section, adjectival compounds
are similar to nominal compounds in the types of relations that obtain between the constituents, and are
not given separate treatment in this text.) A few compound bases occur only in verbs and related
formations. The great majority of compound bases occur in intransitive mag- verbs; a few occur in verbs of
other types.

(a) Nominal compounds serving as verb bases. Some examples of nominal compounds that occur as
verb bases are:

basag-ulo ‘fight’ in magbasag-ulo ‘engage in a fight’ (cf. basag ‘break’; ulo ‘head’)

bukang-liwayway ‘dawn’ in magbukang-liway way ‘be dawn’ (cf. buka ‘open’; liwayway ‘dawn’)

buntung-hininga ‘sigh’ in magbuntung-hininga ‘sigh’ (cf. bunton ‘heap’; hininga ‘breath’)

hunusdili ‘self-control’ in maghunusdili ‘show self—control’ (cf. hunos ‘storm’; dili (negator))

laglag-luksa ‘ritual of ending a mourning period’ in maglaglag-luksa ‘end a mourning period’ (cf. laglag,
base of malaglag ‘fall’; luksa ‘mourning’)

(b) Adjectival compounds serving as verb bases. Some examples of adjectival compounds serving as
verb bases are:

agaw-buhay ‘near death’ in mag-agaw-buhay ‘be near death’ (cf. agaw, base of umagaw ‘snatch’; buhay
‘life’)

amuy-sibuyas (/-bawang, etc.) ‘smelling of onions (/gatlic, etc.)’ in mag-amuy-sibuyas (/-bawang, ¢tc.)
‘smell of onions (/garlic, etc.)’ (cf. amoy ‘smell’; sibuyas ‘onion(s)’; bawang ‘garlic’)

lakas-loob ‘daring’ (often used as adverb, ‘daringly’) in maglakas-loob ‘be daring’ (cf. lakas ‘strength’;

loob ‘inside’)

lasang-kape (/-mansanas, etc.) ‘tasting of coffee (/apples, etc.)’ in maglasang-kape (/mansanas, etc.)
‘have a taste of coffee (/apples, etc.)’ (cf. lasa ‘taste’; kape ‘coffee’; mansanas ‘apple(s)’)

mukhang-bata (/-pulubi, etc.) ‘looking young (/like a beggar, etc.)’ in magmukhang-bata (/-pulubi,
etc.) look young (/like a beggar, etc.)’ (cf. mukha ‘face’; bata ‘young’; pulubi ‘beggar’)

(c) Other compound bases. Compound bases that do not occur as nominal or adjectival compounds
may be divided into two groups: (c.1) those that form directional mag-/-an verbs (cf. §5.4, class B.1); (c.2)
those that form intransitive mag- verbs.

(c.1) Compound bases in this class consist of the base bigay (cf. magbigay /ibigay /bigyan ‘give’) plus
the linker -ng plus another base. In the case of the -an verbs, -an precedes the Jinker. (The linker and the

Elements sous droits d'auteur
360 CHAPTER 5

base that follows it are, however, inseparable from the rest of the verb, and hence differ from base adjuncts
of similar shape ~ cf. §5.26.) Examples are:

bigay-halaga in magbigay-halaga/bigyang-halaga ‘give value to’ (cf. halaga ‘value’)
bigay-pag-asa in magbigay-pag-asa/bigyang-pag-asa ‘give hope to’ (cf. pag-asa *hope’)

(c.2) Examples of compound bases that do not occur as nominal or adjectival compounds and that
form intransitive mag- verbs are:

-akyat-panaog in mag-akyat-panaog ‘go up and down’ (cf. akyat in umakyat ‘go up’; panaog in
pumanaog ‘go down’)

-bayad-utang in magbayad-utang ‘pay a debt’ (cf. bayad ‘payment’; utang ‘debt’)

-dalantao in magdalantao ‘be pregnant’ (cf, dala in magdala ‘carry’; tao ‘human being’)

-urong-sulong in mag-urong-sulong ‘be indecisive’ (cf. urong in umurong ‘retreat’; sulong in sumulong
‘advance’)

(4) PHRASAL BASES. These bases contain sequences of independently meaningful elements that
also occur as phrases (i.e., word sequences that constitute grammatical units). Some include, in addition to
the elements that occur in the phrases themselves, the prefix pa- (and hence may be called derived phrasal
bases). Among the phrase types that may occur as verb bases are: (a) sa phrases; (b) wala phrases; (c)
modification constructions and other phrases.

(a) Sa phrases serving as bases. Sa phrases preceded by the prefix pa- occur as bases of -tm- verbs. (In
most cases, these -ur- verbs are intransitive (cf. §5.6, class T); in at least one case, the -w- verb is
directional and corresponds to a DF -an verb: pumaroon{paroonan ‘go (there)’. The pa- that precedes the
sa phrase may be considered a replacement of the na- that occurs in locative adjective phrases introduced by
nasa (cf. §4.19). Any locative adjective phrase other than those that include kay may serve as the source of
the verb base. The verb expresses motion toward the location expressed by the locative phrase, or motion
that results in the state (of temporary possession) expressed by the locative phrase. Examples are:

pasa-akin in pumasa-akin ‘come into my possession’ (cf. nasa akin ‘in my possession’)

pasabata in pumasabata ‘come into the child’s possession’ (cf. nasa bata ‘in the child’s possession’)
pasaloob in pumasaloob ‘go/come inside’ (cf. nasa loob ‘inside’)

pasa-Maynila in pumasa-Maynila ‘go to Manila’ (cf. nasa Maynila ‘in Manila’)

parito in pumarito ‘come here’ (cf. narito ‘here’)

paroon in pumaroon ‘go (there)’ (cf. naroon ‘there’)

Parito and paroon also occur as bases of adjunctive pseudo—transitive -an verbs (cf. §5.26, class
III.B.1): pariruhan ‘come to... for’ and paroonan ‘go to... for.’ (The latter is homonymous with the DF
verb paroonan ‘go (there)’ — see above.)

Possessive sa phrases of the shape sa plus sa- form personal pronoun (cf, §4.22) also occur as bases of
intransitive -um- verbs: e.g.,

sa akin ‘mine’ in suma-akin ‘be mine’
sa iyo ‘yours’ in suma-iyo ‘be yours’
sa kaniya ‘his/hers’ in suma-kaniya ‘be his/hers’

(These verbs occur primarily in writing and formal speech.)

Certain locative adverbial phrases of the shape sa plus unmarked noun (cf. §6.9) occur as bases of
mag-/i- object verbs (cf. §5.3, class C.2). The phrases express a position or state, the verbs the putting of
something into that position or state. Examples are:

sa ayos ‘in(to) order’ in magsaayos/isaayos ‘put in order’

sa dula ‘in(to) a play’ in magsadula/isadula ‘put into dramatic form’
sa ulo ‘in(to) the head” in magsauto/isaulo ‘memorize (i.e., ‘put into one's head’)

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 361

(b) Wala phrases serving as bases. Certain wala phrases preceded by the prefix pa- occur as bases of

mag-/-an directional verbs (cf, $5.4, class B.1), The wala phrase itself consists of the negator wala plus the
linker -ng plus a base (cf. §7.14). As in the case of compound bases with bigay (see (3.c), above), -ar
precedes the linker. (Wala +-an forms the irregular verb walan — cf. §5.24 — which combines with the
linker to form walang.)

pawalang-bisa in magpawalang-bisa/pawalang-bisa ‘render ineffective’ (cf. walang bisa ‘having no
effect’)

pawalang-halaga in magpawalang-halaga/pawalang-halaga ‘render valucless’ (cf. walang halaga ‘having
no value’)

Certain wala phrases (without a preceding pa-) also occur as bases of intransitive mag- verbs: e.g.,

walang kibo ‘without speech’ in magwalang-kibo ‘be silent’
walang hiya ‘without shame’ in magwalang-hiya ‘be shameless”

(c) Modification constructions and other phrases serving as bases. Examples of modification
constructions (cf. §§3.11 ff.) serving as bases are:

ibang bayan ‘another country’ in mangibang-bayan ‘go abroad’

mabuting asal ‘good manners’ in magmabuting.-asal/pagmabutihang-asal ‘be courteous to”

magandang gabi ‘good evening (the greeting)" in magmagandang-gabi ‘wish (someone) good evening’

masamang ugali ‘bad custom’ in magmasamang-ugali/pagmasamaang-ugali ‘behave selfishly toward’

tininti sa nayon ‘barrio lieutenant’ (an optional contraction of tininting nasa nayon — cf. §3.14) in
magtininti-sa-nayon ‘be barrio leutenant’

(Note that in the case of pag-.. . -an verbs, the -ant occurs before the linker na/-ng. Cf. the discussion under
(3.c) above.)
At least one phrase of a type not discussed above occurs as a verb base:

baka sakali ‘perhaps’ in magbaka-sakali ‘take a chance’

§5.19 The contemplated aspect.

Tagalog verbs are inflectable for three basic aspects: CONTEMPLATED, IMPERFECTIVE, and
PERFECTIVE. Certain tagalog verbs are inflectable as well for a fourth, derived aspect: the RECENT
PERFECTIVE. The meanings typically associated with the basic aspects are summarized in §2.7. (In
certain derived structures ~ ¢.g., certain types of adverbial clauses (cf. §6.14, ff.) — the basic aspects may
carry meanings that differ to some extent from those typically associated with them.) The present section
and those that immediately follow it are concerned with the ways in which verbs marked for one of the
three basic aspects are formed. Contemplated—aspect formations are discussed in the present section,
imperfective—aspect formations in §5.20, and perfective—aspect formations in §5.21. The basic—aspect
formations are summarized in §5.22. Then, in §5.23, recent—perfective formations, their meanings, and
the constructions in which they occur are presented.

All contemplated—aspect formations are marked by the presence of a monosyllabic duplicating prefix
that does not occur in the basic form of the verb, This prefix may be symbolized dup,-. Dup,-, the

aspectual—duplication prefix, occurs in imperfective—aspect and recent—perfective—aspect formations (cf.
§§5.20 and 5.23, respectively) as well as in contemplated—aspect formations. It differs both in use and in
form from the other duplicating prefixes that occur in verb formations, dup,- and dup.-. The latter are
used to form derived verbs, and occur in the basic form, as well as in the aspect—marked forms, of such
verbs. Dup,-, on the other hand, occurs in both major—verb and derived—verb formations, but, since it is
an aspectual marker, never occurs in a basic form. The rules governing the form of dup,-and dup.- are
presented in §§3.7 and 5.16 respectively; those governing the form of dup,- are presented immediately
below. (These rules are to be understood as applying to the form of dup,- in all the aspect—marked

362 CHAPTER $

formations in which it occurs: i.e., in imperfective—aspect and recent—perfective—aspect formations; as
well as in contemplated—aspect formations.)

(1) Dup,- normally consists of a duplication of the first consonant and first vowel of the syllable
before which it occurs, The vowel of dup,- is, however, always long, whether the vowel of the syllable it
precedes is long or short. Note the following examples of contemplated—aspect formations in which dup, -
precedes a syllable with a short vowel (dup, - is capitalized in the examples): B/bithin /bi-bilhin/ ‘will buy,’
LUtutuin [luslutu"'in{ ‘will cook,’ WAwalisan /wa'wali'san/ ‘will sweep.”

(2) When dup, - precedes a syllable that begins with a consonant cluster the second member of which
is /w/ or fy/, it consists of the first consonant of the cluster plus the long—vowel counterpart of /w/ or
ly{ — fu'] in the case of /w/, Ji] in the case of /y/, Examples are: magK Ukwento /magku'kwe'ntoh/ ‘will
tell a story,” magPipyano /magpi*pya*noh/ ‘will play the piano.”

(3) When dup,- precedes a syllable that befins with a consonant cluster the second member of which
is /r/ or /1/, it may optionally include the /r/ or /1/ as well as the first consonant of the cluster. Examples
are: mag7(Rj)Atrabaho /magt(r)a‘traba‘hoh/ ‘will work,’ magP(] JAplantsa /magp(1)a‘pla‘ntsah/ ‘will iron.’
The formations without the /r/ or /1/ are, however, preferred.

Dup,- in some cases must immediately precede the verb base, in others must immediately precede a
component of the verbal affix, and in still others may immediately precede either the verb base or a
component of the verbal affix. The following generalizations can be made about the position of dup,-.
(The generalizations apply, once more, to all formations in which dup, - occurs.)

(1) Certain affixes and affix components are never immediately preceded by dup, -. These affixes
are:

(a) the major monosyllabic prefixes: e.g., -, mta-, mag-;

(b) derived affixes and initial components of derived affixes that are identical in shape to major
monosyllabic prefixes: e.g., i- as a benefactive—focus affix, or as the initial component of ika-,
ipa-, ipag-, etc.; ma- as an ability—verb affix, or as the initial component of maka-, makapag-,
mai-, etc.

(c) _ the suffixes -an and -in;

(d) the affix components pag- and pang- when preceded by ka-, ki, or si-, as in makapag-,
makapang-, mangakipag-, miagsipang-, etc.

(e) the recent—perfective affix component ka- (cf. §5.23), the pluralizing affix component -nga-
(cf. §5.15), and the deliberate reflexive affix component fi- (cf. §5.12).

(2) A verb base is never immediately preceded by dup,- if the formation includes one of the
following affixes or affix components: dup,-, dup2-, Ki-, magpa-, pagka-, pagpa-, pampa-, si-. Dup,- and
dup2- are never immediately preceded by dup ,- if the formation includes one of the other listed affixes or
affix components.

(3) Any affix component not specified under (1) above may be immediately preceded by dup,-.
Thus dup,- may precede the following affix components: dup,- and dup,- except as specified under (2)
above, ka- except as specified under (1.e) above, ki-, # occurring as a non-initial affix component, pa-, pag-
and pang- except as specified under (1.d) above, si-.

(4) Any verb base not preceded by the affixes and affix components specified under (2) above may
be immediately preceded by dup,-.

As generalizations (3) and (4) indicate, dup, - is in some cases capable of occurring in one of two or
more different positions in formations corresponding to a single basic form. Thus the contemplated—aspect
form of the verb maipabili ‘be able to have (someone) buy’ may be any of the following: malipabili,
maiPApabili, maipaBlbili. No general rule can be given as to which of two or more alternative positions of
dup,- is likely to be preferred in any given case.

As is noted in §5.2, subsection (12), the initial base consonant of verbs formed with the prefix
mang-, and of most other verbal prefixes ending in -ng, is in certain specifiable cases replaced by its

Elamante cone droite diantenr

nn
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 363

homorgani¢ nasal counterpart, the final nasal of the prefix being simultaneously lost. In such casts, it is the

nasal that replaces the first base consonant that is duplicated in dup,-. Thus, for example, the
contemplated—aspect form that corresponds to the basic form sramili (mang- + bili) ‘go shopping’ is
maMImili_ {mami milih{ ‘will go shopping,’ the contemplated—aspect form that corresponds to manaksak
(mang: + saksak) ‘stab’ is maNAnaksak /mana‘naksak/ ‘will stab,” and the contemplated—aspect form that
corresponds to mangailangan (mang- + kailangan) ‘need’ is maNGAngailangan }/mana‘na‘ila*nan/ ‘will need.’

The contemplated—aspect form of an -wm- verb is differentiated from the basic form in two
ways: (1) the presence of dup, -; (2) the absence of the infix -m-. Examples are:

Basic Form

lumakad /luma‘kad/ ‘walk’
tumakbo /tumakboh/ ‘run’
umalis /’umalis/ ‘leave’

Contemplated—Aspect Form
Lalakad /la‘la’kad/ ‘will walk’
TAtakbo /ta‘takboh/ ‘will run’
Aalis /’a°’alis/ ‘will leave”

In most other cases, the contemplated—aspect form is differentiated from the basic form only by the
presence of dup,-. Any affix other than -um that occurs in the basic form of a verb is, in other words,
normally retained in the corresponding contemplated—aspect form. (However, cf. §5.22 for a discussion of
the optimal deletion of i- in the contemplated—aspect forms of znai- verbs, etc.) Some examples are:

Basic Form
bigyan /bigyan/ ‘give to’

iabot /i’abot/ ‘hand to’

ikagalit /’ikaga‘Jit/
‘make angry”

makita /ma(*)ki‘tah/ ‘see’

mangagsikain /managsika’’in/
‘eat (pl.)’

pag-aralan /pag’ara‘lan/
‘study’

pangisdaan /panisda’an/
‘go fishing in*

tapusin /tapu'sin/ ‘finish’

Contemplated—Aspect Form
Blbigyan /bi-bigyan/ ‘will give to’

iAabot j’i’a’’abot/ ‘will hand to’
iKAkagalit /’ikaka‘ga'lit/
ikaGAgalit /*ikaga*ga‘lit/

‘will make angry”

maKIkita /ma(-)ki‘ki‘tah/
‘will see”

mangagSlsikain /managsi‘sika’’in/
‘will eat (pl.)°

PAPag-aralan /pa‘pag’ara‘lan/
pag-Aaralan /pag‘a’’ara‘lan/

paNGIngisdaan /pani'nisda’an/
‘will go fishing in’

TAtapusin /ta*tapusin/
‘will finish’

§5.20. The imperfective aspect.
All imperfective—aspect formations are marked by the presence of: (1) the aspectual—duplication
prefix dup,-; (2) an aspect—marking element that may be symbolized as N. The formation and position of

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
364 CHAPTER 5

dup ,- have been presented in detail in §5.19. The forms of the aspect—marking element N are presented in
the present section. N occurs in perfective—aspect formations as well as in imperfective—aspect formations,
and the generalizations made below apply to N in formations of both types.

(1) When present in a formation whose basic form begins with a prefix with initial /m/, N is realized
as a replacement of this /m/ by /n/. Thus, N + ma-D na- {na(-)/, N + mag- /mag/ > nag- /nag/, etc. Some
examples of verbs whose basic forms begin with a prefix with initial /m/, and of the imperfective—aspect
forms of the verbs, are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form

mahalata ‘notice’ nahahalata ‘is/are noticing’
nakakarinig)

makarinig ‘hear’ ‘isfare hearing’
nakaririnig {

maglinis ‘clean’ naglilinis ‘is/are cleaning”
nangakakaalis

mangakaalis ‘be able to ) ‘are able to leave’

leave (pl.)’ j
nangakaaalis

mangisda ‘go fishing’ nangingisda ‘is/are going fishing’

(As is noted in §2.7, the imperfective aspect may be used to express habitual actions or incomplete actions
in the present or the past. Thus a form like nangingisda may, according to context, correspond to English
‘go(es) fishing,” ‘is/are going fishing,’ ‘was/were going fishing,” etc. Only the translations that indicate
incomplete action in the present are given in the examples.)

(2) In the case of -um- verbs, N is realized as the retention of the infix -wm-. Put
formulaically: N +-um- > -um-. (As is noted in §5.19, the contemplated—aspect forms of -wm- verbs,
which lack N, are marked by the absence of the infix -um-.) Note that, in imperfective—aspect formations,
-um- always occurs after the initial consonant of dup, -. Examples are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form

kumain /kuma‘’in/ ‘eat’ kumakain /kuma‘ka‘'in/ ‘is/are cating’
sumakay /sumakay/ ‘ride" sumasakay /suma‘sakay/ ‘is/are riding”
umiyak /"umiyak/ ‘cry’ umilyak /’umi*’iyak/ ‘is/are crying’

(3) In all cases not covered by (1) or (2) above, the realization of N involves the prefix ni- /ni/ or the
infix -in- jin/. (In the case of verbs whose basic form includes the suffix -in, the realization of N also

involves loss of this suffix — cf. (4), below.) The following formulas summarize the realization of N as ni- or
sine:

{nil}
(a) N+ (f'i/ +) /L{ > (fit +)

{Lin/
(b) N+ /'i/ + /H/ > Lif + [ni]
(c) N+(fi/ +) /C/ > (Lif +) (Cinf

In all three formulas, /’i/ represents the prefix or prefix component é-. /L/ in formula (a) represents one of
four consonants: /1/, /r/, /w/, and /y/; /H/ in formula (b) represents one of two consonants: /h/ and /*/;

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 365

{C/ in formula (c) represents any consonant other than (1), /r/, /w/, or /y/ if the formation does not include
the prefix or prefix component i-, and any consonant other than /If, /r/, /w/, /y/, /h/, or /’/ if the formation
does include #. The formulas are to be interpreted as follows:

(a) When N is present in a formation that would, in the absence of N, begin with /I/, /r/, /w/, or /y/,
or with the prefix i- plus one of these consonants, N may be realized in either of two ways: as ni- preceding
the fi/, /r/, /w/, or /y/, or as -in- following it. The forms with ni- are preferred to those with -in-. (In
imprefective—aspect formations covered by formula (a), /L/ is the initial consonant of dup,-.) Examples
are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form
nilalagyan

lagyan ‘put infon* ‘isfare putting in/on’
linalagyan

ilapit “bring near’ ‘is/are bringing near’

iwinawagay way
niyayapakan

yapakan ‘step on’ ‘is/are stepping on’
yinayapakan
iniyuyuko

iyuko ‘bend’ ‘isfare bending’
iyiniyuko

(Cf. also §5.22 for a discussion of the optimal deletion of the prefix or prefix—component /-, in certain
formations that involve N.)

(b) When N is present in a formation that would, in the absence of N, begin with the prefix # plus /h/
or /"/, it is realized as ni- preceding the /h/ or /'/, Examples are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form
ihatid ‘deliver’ inihahatid ‘is/are delivering’
iabot /‘i’abot/ ‘hand to’ iniaabot /ini’a’’abot/ ‘isfare handing to”

(c) When N is present in a formation that begins with a consonant other than /I/, /r/, /w/, or /y/, or
that would in the absence of N, begin with the prefix * plus a consonant other than /I/, /r/, /w/, /y/, {hf or
/'J, it is realized as -in- following this consonant. Examples are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form
hiraman ‘borrow from’ hinihiraman ‘is/are borrowing from’
utusan /*utu-san/ ‘order’ inuutusan /’inu'utu'san/ ‘is/are ordering’
bigyan ‘give to” binibigyan ‘is/are giving to’
ibigay ‘give’ ibinibigay ‘is/are giving’

pinapabigyan
pabigyan ‘have (someonc) give to” ‘is/are having

(someone) give to”
pinabibigyan

(As the last example shows, the position of /in/ is not affected by the position of dup, -.)

(Cf. §5.21 for a note on formations that involve the addition of -in- after the first consonant of a
consonant cluster the second member of which is /I/ or /r/.)

(4) In formations whose basic form includes the suffix -in (i.e., in -in verbs, and in verbs formed with
complex affixes that include -ir), the realization of N involves: (1) the addition of ni- or -in- in accordance
with the formulas presented under (3), above; (2) the deletion of the suffix -i. Examples are:

Basic Form Imperfective—Aspect Form
niluluto

lutuin cook’ ‘is/are cooking’
linuluto
niyayaya

yayain ‘invite’ ‘isfare inviting’
yinayaya

awitin ‘sing’ inaawit ‘is/are singing’

unatin ‘stretch’ inuunat ‘is/are stretching’

basahin ‘read’ binabasa ‘is/are reading’
pinapapaglaba

papaglabahin ‘have (someone) launder’ ‘isfare having

(someone) launder’

pinapaglalaba

As is noted in §5.2, subsection (4), the addition of the suffix -in to a verb base with penultimate
vowel length normally effects a length shift in the base. Compare: dito flu'to'/ and lutuin flutu:'in{, awit
['a'wit/ and awitin [’awi‘tin], basa foa*sah/ and basahin {basa*hin/. When the suffix -in is deleted as part of
the realization of the aspect—marking element N, the length shift does not occur. Thus: linuluto
flinu'lu‘to’/, inaawit f*ina*'a'wit/, binabasa fbina‘ba’sah/. (Note that conventional spelling represents the
distinction between base—final /’/ and base—final /h/ in forms in which the base is followed by -in — fh/
being represented by /h/, /’/ being unwritten — but does not represent this distinction in unsuffixed forms.)

§5.21. The perfective aspect.
Perfective—aspect formations like imperfective—aspect formations (cf. §5.20), are marked by the
presence of the aspect-marking element N. The perfective formations differ from the imperfective

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
rere eee eS
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 367

formations in that they lack the aspectual—duplication prefix dup, -. The same rules govern the realization
of N in perfective and imperfective formations. Thus N in perfective formations is realized in onc of the
following four ways, the particular realization that occurs in any given case depending upon the structure of
the basic form of the verb, as specified in $5.20:

(1) __ the replacement of prefix—initial {m/ by /nj;

(2) _ the retention of the infix -um-;

(3) _ the addition of ni- or -in-;

(4) the addition of ni- or -in- plus the deletion of the suffix -in.

(Cf. also §5.22 for the optional deletion of & in certain formations that involve N.) Examples are:

Basic Form Perfective—Aspect Form
(1) | makagawa ‘be able to do’ nakagawa ‘was/were able to do’
mag-aral ‘study’ nag-aral ‘studied’
maintindihan ‘understand’ naintindihan ‘understood’
(2) dumating ‘arrive’ dumating ‘arrived’
sumulat ‘write’ sumulat ‘wrote”
tumanggap ‘receive’ tumanggap ‘received’
niligawan
(3) _ligawan ‘pay court to” ‘paid court to”
linigawan
iniyaman
iyaman ‘cause to get rich’ ‘caused to get rich”
iyinaman
iuwi ‘take home” injuwi ‘took home”
pagturuan ‘teach at” pinagturuan ‘taught at”
ikamatay ‘cause to die’ ikinamatay ‘caused to die’
nilagot )
(4) _ lagutin ‘snap’ ‘snapped’
linagot j
ubusin ‘use up” inubos ‘used up’
pabalikin ‘have (someone) return’ pinabalik ‘had (someone) return’

(Note that, as the examples under (2) show, the imperfective—aspect form of an -um- verb is identical with
the basic form.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur

 
368 CHAPTER §

In perfective—aspect formations in which -in- is inserted after the first consonant of a consonant
cluster the second member of which is /I/ or /r/, a short vowel is optionally but preferably inserted between
the /n/ of -in- and the /l/ or /r/. The particular short vowel that occurs is determined by the vowel that
follows the /r/ or /I/. If this vowel is /i(-)/ or /e(*)/, the added short vowel is /i/; if it is /u(:)/, the added
short vowel is /u/; if it is fa(-)/, the added short vowel is /a/. Examples are:

Basic Form Perfective—Aspect Form

iprito /‘ipritoh/ ‘fry’ ipin(i)rito /’ipin(i)ri-toh/
“fried”

iprenda /’ipre‘ndah/ ‘pledge as security’ ipin(i)renda /*ipin(i)re‘ndah/

§5.22. Summary of basic aspect formations.

A detailed treatment of the formations that mark the three basic aspects has been presented in
§§5.19 through 5.21. As is noted in these sections, each of the three basic aspects is marked by certain
modifications of the basic form of the verb, The contemplated aspect is marked by the addition to the basic
form of the aspectual—duplication prefix, dup, - (cf. §5.19). (The contemplated aspect of -wm- verbs is also
marked by the deletion of -wem-.) The imperfective aspect is marked both by the addition of dup, - and the

presence of the aspect—marking element N. (The various realizations of N are presented in § §5.20 and
5.21.) And the perfective aspect is marked by the presence of N. Stated formulsically:

Contemplated Aspect = dup,- + Basic Form*
Imperfective Aspect = N + dup,- + Basic Form
Perfective Aspect N + Basic Form

(*For -um- verbs, the formula must be changed to: Contemplated Aspect = dup,- + Base.)

Since the position of dup, - is to some extent variable, and the realizations of N are quite diverse, a
more detailed summary than is provided by the above formulas may be useful: a summary in which are
specified the position(s) of dup,- and the realization(s) of N that characterize the aspect—marked
counterparts of basic forms of various given structures. Such a summary is presented in Chart 20. The first
column of the chart formularizes the structure of twelve types of basic forms, each formed with a different
common affix. (The formulas are listed alphabetically, according to the first letter of the affix.) The
second, third, and fourth columns of the chart formularize, respectively, the contemplated—aspect,
imperfective—aspect, and perfective—aspect forms that correspond to the basic forms in the first column.
The symbol B in the chart represents a verb base, and d- represents the aspectual—duplication prefix dup,-.
Affixes are shown in the position in which they occur in the given formation, except that it is to be
understood that, in actual verb forms, infixes (-ir- and -um-) follow the first consonant of the element listed
after them in the chart. The chart does not take account of alternation between the -in- and ni- realizations
of the aspect~marking element N; the symbol -in- in the chart is to be understood as representing mi- as well
in appropriate cases.

Not shown in Chart 20, and not presented in detail in §§5.19 through 5.21, are certain optional
variants of basic—aspect—marked forms of verbs whose basic forms involve the prefix or prefix component
i-. These optional variants lack the # that occurs in the basic form of the verb, but otherwise generally
follow the previously presented rules for basic—aspect—marked forms. /- is optionally deletable in:

(1) imperfective—aspect and perfective—aspect forms (i.e., forms that include the aspect—marking
element N) of most verbs whose basic forms include the prefix, either alone or as part of a complex
prefix: e.g.,

(i)pinapagluto |

(*When the formation with i- shows the initial sequence /*i/ + /nill/ (cf. §5.20), the formation without i-
shows the initial sequence /Hin/.)

(2) All basic—aspect—marked forms of most verbs in whose basic forms i follows the
ability —involuntary—action prefix ma- (cf. §5.13): ¢.g.,

Basic Form Aspect—Marked Forms
ma(i)bibigay ‘will be able to give”
maibigay ‘be able to give” na(i)bibigay ‘is/are able to give’

na(i)bigay ‘was/were able to give’

naiipagluto*
na(i)pagluto ‘was/were able to cook for’

(*Wheni- is immediately preceded by dup,-, it is not deletable.)

Eis never deleted from causative~focus formations (cf. §5.8) or measurement—focus formations (cf.
§5.10): thus no deletion of i- is possible in the imperfective—aspect and contemplated—aspect forms that
correspond to ikapagbigay ‘cause to give’ and itaas ‘grow,’ or in the basic—aspect—marked forms that
correspond to maikapagbigay “be able to cause to give.’ /- is also obligatorily retained in instrumental—focus
formations that do not include pang- (cf. §5.11): thus no deletion of # is possible in the

imperfective—aspect and contemplated—aspect forms that correspond to IF iswklay and ipagsuklay ‘comb
with.’

§5.23. The recent—perfective aspect.
Verbs inflected for the recent—perfective aspect express actions completed just before the moment of
speaking or just before some other specified time. Sentences with recent—perfective formations in predicate

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
372 CHAPTER 5

position are equivalent to English sentences that include ‘has/have just’ or ‘had just’ plus a past
participle: e.g.,

Kakakain ko lamang.
‘I have just eaten.’

Kaaalis pa lamang ni Pedro (nang dumating ako).
‘Pedro had just left (when I arrived).”

While all verbs are inflectable for the three basic aspects presented in § §5.19 through 5.22, only
actor—focus verbs are inflectable for the recent—perfective aspect, and then only if the verbal affix is one of
the following: -wm-, ma-, maka-, mag-, magpa-, mang-. In the case of maka-, only major verbs formed with
the affix have recent—perfective forms: thus there is a recent—perfective form corresponding to the major
verb makarinig ‘hear,’ but there is no recent—perfective form corresponding to the ability verb makabili, ‘be
able to buy.”

All recent—perfective formations are marked by the presence of: (1) the prefix ka- /ka/; (2) the
aspectual—duplication prefix dup,-. (The formation of dup,-, and the positions in which it occurs, are
presented in detail in §5.19.) Certain recent—perfective formations include other prefix components as
well. The correspondences that obtain between the affixes that occur in basic and recent—perfective forms
are shown in Chart 21.

As the chart shows, the recent—perfective forms of mag- and magpa- verbs in some cases include the
prefix component pag-. Pag- is obligatory in the case of recent—perfective forms of all derived mag- verbs
(cf. §5.16), and of certain major mag- verbs whose bases also occur as the bases of -uz- verbs. Thus pag: is
obligatory in the recent—perfective forms of the derived verbs magbasa ‘read (intensively) (cf. burasa
‘read’) and maglakad ‘walk (intensively)’ (cf. kenakad ‘walk’), and of the major verb magbili ‘sell’ (cf.
bumili ‘buy’). In the case of most other mag- verbs, and of all magpa- (indirect—action) verbs, pag- is
optional, and the forms without it are preferred. Some examples of the correspondences shown in Chart 21
are:

There is also a set of INTENSIVE RECENT-PERFECTIVE formations that involve, in addition to
the affixes shown in Chart 21, the duplicating prefix dup, - (cf. §5.16). These intensive formations express
extremely recent actions, and are equivalent to English expressions that involve ‘just this minute,’ ‘just a
short time ago,” etc. The positions occupied by dup- in intensive recent—perfective formations may be

‘374 CHAPTER 5

summarized as follows: in the case of -um-, ma-, maka-, and mag: verbs, dup2- immediately precedes the
verb base; in the case of magpa- verbs, dup2- may either precede the verb base or occur between dup ,- and
pa-, the latter position being preferred; in the case of mang- verbs, dup- occurs between dup, - and pang-.
Some examples are:

kakakain kakakain-kain
kapapagbasa kapapagbasa-basa
kapagbabasa kapagbabasa-basa

kapagpapagupit-gupit

kapapanganak )
kapapanga-panganak
kapanganganak j

Recent—perfective—aspect formations are optionally but frequently followed by the enclitic particle
pa (cf. §6.3), and are obligatorily followed by the enclitic particle lamang/lang (cf. §6.4, subsection (d)).
The formations never occur with topics, but take instead an actor complement in the form of ang phrase,
plus any other complement(s) taken by the other forms of the same verb. Some examples of sentences with
recent—perfective predicates are:

Kakakain ko (pa) I(am)ang ng karne.
‘T have just eaten some/the meat.”

(ef. Kumain ako ng kane.
‘L ate some meat.’)

Kapapasulat

Kapasusulat (pa) I(am)ang ng Tatay kay Jose ng liham sa diyaryo.
Kapagpapasulat

‘Father has just had Jose write a/the letter to the newspaper.”

(cf. Nagpasulat ang Tatay kay Jose ng liham sa diyaryo.
‘Father had Jose write a letter to the newspaper.”)

Kapapanguha )
(pa) \(am)ang ng bata ng mga mangga.

Kapangunguha j

‘The child has just gathered some/the mangoes.”

(cf. Nanguha ang bata ng mga mangga.
‘The child gathered some mangoes.”)

As the English translations of the examples show, a ng-phrase object complement after a
recent—perfective formation may be either indefinite or definite in reference. (Ng-phrase object
complements in other cases are normally indefinite in reference — cf. §5.25.) If it is wished to make the

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
a eee Se
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 375

definite reference explicit, a sa-phrase object complement may replace the ng-phrase object
complement: e.g.,

Kakakain ko (pa) I(am)ang sa karne.
‘Ihave just eaten the meat.”

(In other cases, sa-phrase object complements may occur only after nominalized verbs.)

§5.24. Irregular verb formations.

Certain verbs formed with the suffixes -an and -i, or with complex affixes that include these suffixes
(e.g., Ka-...-ait, pa-...-in), are irregular. In irregular verb formations, the shape of the verb base shows
certain differences from the shape of the same base in citation or in formations that do not include a suffix.
(The differences referred to are differences other than those that reflect the regular process of length
shift — cf. §1.12 —or the regular phonemic interchanges of fo} and /u/, /d/ and /r/ — cf. §§1.10 and
1,20.) The most common type of irregular formation involves clision of the vowel in the final syllable of a
base that lacks inherent vowel length, Thus, for example, the base bukas /bukas/ forms, with -an, the
irregular verb buksan /buksan/ ‘open.’ (This may be compared with the regular formation wakasan
{wakasan/ ‘put a stop to,” formed with the base wakas /wakas/.) Elision of this type, which characterizes a
number of the most common -an and -in verbs in the language, occurs very rarely in cases where the
penultimate syllable of the base ends in a consonant: thus, pura /puntah/ +-an +> puntahan {puntahan/
‘go to.” (Note, however, the form hintin fhintin/ ‘wait for,’ formed with the base hintay fhintay/, which
does show clision of the vowel in the final syllable of the base, as well as elision of the base — final
consonant.) When the citation form of the base ends in /*/ and the vowel of the base—final syllable is
deleted in an irregular verb formation, the /’/ is also deleted. An example is gawin /gawin/ ‘make, do,’ an -in
verb formed with the base gawa /gawa’/.

The occurring irregular -ar and -in formations are listed below in alphabetical order. Only the basic
forms of the irregular verbs are shown, but it is to be understood that the inflected forms generally show
the same irregularities. Thus the inflected forms of the irregular verb bigyan /bigyan/ ‘give to’ (base: bigay
foigay/): are: bibigyan /bi'bigyan/ ‘will give to,’ binibigyan /bini*bigyan/ ‘is/are giving to,’ binigyan
/binigyan/ ‘gave to.’ In the case of irregular verbs whose basic form includes the suffix -in, however, the
imperfective and perfective forms of the verb are regular, since the suffix does not occur in these forms (cf.
$§5.20 and 5.21). Thus, the imperfective and perfective forms of the irregular verb hingin {hinin/ ‘ask for’
(base: hingi /hini’/) are, respectively, the regular formations hinihing? /hini-hini’/ ‘isfare asking for’ and
hiningi /hinini’/ ‘asked for.”

In most cases, the listed irregular formations are -an or -int verbs. It is to be understood, however, that
any verbs formed with the same base and with complex affixes that include the suffix -an or the suffix -in
show the same irregularities of formation. Thus, while only bigyai ‘give to” appears on the list, such derived
verbs as mabigyan ‘be able to give to,’ pabigyan ‘permit/cause to give to,” pagbigyan ‘give (to) at/in,’ etc.,
are also irregular. In cases where the base forms irregular verbs with complex affixes that include -an or -in,
but either does not occur with -an or -in alone, or does not form irregular verbs with them, a pertinent
formation that includes a complex affix is listed.

In some cases, a base occurs with -ar or -in in both regular and irregular formations. In some cases, if
the two formations have the same meaning, only the irregular formation is given, and an asterisk is placed

after it. Thus the notation dakpin® (/dakpin/ ‘arrest’ — base: dakip /dakip/) indicates that, in addition to
the irregular formation, there is a regular formation with the same meaning (dekipin /dakipin/ ‘arrest’). If
the regular formation is considerably more common than the irregular one, the asterisk is immediately
preceded by the letter r (for ‘rare’) in parenthesis. Thus the notation alsan (r)* (/'alsan/ ‘leave’ — base: alis
falisf) indicates that there is a regular formation that has the same meaning and is of considerably more
common occurrence (alisan /'alisan/ ‘leave’). If the regular and irregular formations differ in meaning, a
note on the occurrence and meaning of the regular formation appears below the listing of the irregular
formation. Notes of various other kinds may also follow the listing in some cases.

(Phrasal bases involving wala — cf. §5.18, subsection (4) — also form irregular verbs with -an: ¢.g.,

§5.25. Summary of verbal complements.
Tagalog has verbal complements of four types: actor complements, object complements, directional

complements, and secondary—actor complements.

A detailed presentation of secondary—actor

complements is to be found in §5,12, subsection (1), and no further information about them is presented

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 381

in the present section. The three types of complements that occur in basic sentences — actor, object, and
directional complements — have been introduced in §2.11; the present section summarizes the information
previously given about these complement types, and presents certain additional details.

(1) THE ACTOR COMPLEMENT. The actor complement is in most cases expressed by a ng
phrase: mg plus an unmarked noun, ni plus a personal noun, the ng form of a personal or deictic
pronoun: e.g.,

ng babae
ni Helen
Binili ang baro.
niya
noon
‘The/A woman
‘Helen
bought the dress.’
‘She
‘That one

An actor complement consisting of ng plus an unmarked noun is usually equivalent to a definite noun
phrase in English (e.g., ‘the woman’), but may occasionally be translated by an indefinite noun phrase as

well (e.g., ‘a woman’). The connotation of definiteness is least clear when the unmarked noun is explicitly
pluralized (cf. §3.9). Thus in the sentence:

Binili ng mga babae ang mga baro.
‘The/Some women bought the dresses.’

the indefinite noun phrase ‘some women’ is as likely a translation equivalent of ng mga babae as is the
definite noun phrase ‘the women.’

When the nominal within an actor complement is a personal pronoun, a sa-form pronoun may in
some cases be used instead of the ng-form pronoun. Unlike the ng-form pronoun, the sa-form pronoun
precedes the verb and is linked to it by the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11). Any enclitic pronouns and/or particles
(cf. §§3.29 and 6.2 through 6.6) occur between the sa pronoun and the linker. The following are some
examples of sentences with sa pronouns serving as actor complements. (The equivalent sentences with
ng-pronoun actor complements are cited in parentheses.)

Aking gagawin ito.
‘Pil do this.’
(cf. Gagawin ko ito.)

Amin siyang tatawagin.
“We'll call him.’
(cf. Tatawagin namin siya.)

Kanila din bang dadaluhan ang pulong?
‘Will they attend the meeting too?’
(cf. Dadaluhan din ba nila ang pulong?)

Sa-pronoun actor complements do not occur in negated sentences. Thus there is no:
*Aking hindi

gagawin ito.
*Hindi aking

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
382 CHAPTER 5

corresponding to:

Hindi ko gagwin ito.
‘I won’t do this.’

(The alternation between ng-pronoun and sa-pronoun actor complements is comparable to that

between ng-pronoun and sa-pronoun possessive modifiers — cf. §3.20.)
(2) THE OBJECT COMPLEMENT. In basic sentences the object complement is expressed by a ng

phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun: e.g.,

(re aksidente
Nakakita ang bata.
noon
{ an accident.’
‘The child saw

some of that.”

Object complements in basic sentences are normally translated by indefinite noun phrases in English.

Within a nominalized verbal (cf. §3.24), an object complement is in some cases expressed by a ng
phrase, in others by a sa phrase, and in still others may be expressed by either a mg phrase or asa phrase.
Only a ng phrase may be used if the verb within the nominalized verbal is a double—object verb. Once more
the ng phrase must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun: e.g.,

ng premyo}
Siya ang nagbigay kay Ben.
rito J
a/the prize )

‘He’s the one who gave to Ben.’

(some of) that{

As the above translations show, a ng-phrase object complement within a nominalized verbal may be either

definite or indefinite in reference.
If the verb within the nominalized verbal is an object verb, and if the nominal within the object

complement is a personal noun or a personal pronoun, only a sa phrase (kay plus personal noun, sa plus
sa-form personal pronoun) may be used to express the object complement: e.g.,

{ kay Jose.
Siya ang nakakita
l sa kanila.

{ Jose.”
‘He’s the one who saw

l them.”

(Note that there is no equivalent construction if the verbal is not nominalized. Thus there is no:

kay Jose.
*Nakakita siya
sa kanila.)

If the verb within the nominalized verbal is an object verb, and if the nominal within the object
complement is an unmarked noun or a deictic pronoun, either a ng phrase or a sa phrase may be used to

SS
VERBALS‘ AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 383

express the object complement. The ng phrase may, as was noted above, be cither definite or indefinite in
reference; the sa phrase is always definite in reference. Examples are:

ng aksidente.
sa aksidente.
Siya ang nakakita
noon.
doon.
an/the accident.’
the accident.’
‘He’s the one who saw

(some of) that.”
that.’

(There is some tendency to prefer ng to sa before an unmarked noun that docs not designate an animate
creature. Thus ng aksidente is preferred to sa aksidente in the above example. Before an unmarked noun
that designates an animate creature, ng and sa are equally common, as in the following example:

{me}
Siya ang nakakita | { duktor
sa

afthe
‘He’s the one who saw doctor.”
the

(3) THE DIRECTIONAL COMPLEMENT. The directional complement is normally expressed by a sa
phrase: sa plus an unmarked noun, Kay plus a personal noun, sa plus the sa form of a personal pronoun, or
the sa form of a deictic pronoun: c.g.,

sa alkalde.

kay Marcos.
Dumalaw ako

sa kaniya.

doon.

the/a mayor.”
Marcos.”
‘I visited
him.”
there (that one).’

A directional complement consisting of sa plus an unmarked noun may be either definite or indefinite in

reference.
In a limited set of cases, a ng-phrase directional complement may occur as an alternant of a sa-phrase

directional complement. The alternation occurs only when the following conditions are met:

(a) The verb is a directional (rather than a double—object) -wm- verb, belonging to either the
-um-/-an or the -um-/-in class (cf. §5.4, classes D.1 and D.2), and is one that expresses
movement from place to place, (Thus -um-/-an directional verbs such as bumalik ‘return to" and
pumunta ‘go to’ allow the alternation, while those such as pumanig ‘take sides with’ do not.

Similarly, -unt/-in directional verbs such as pumasok ‘enter’ and umakyat ‘climb’ allow the
alternation, while those such as ‘humarap ‘face’ do not.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
384 CHAPTER $

(b) The nominal within the directional complement is an unmodified unmarked noun designating a
place (rather than, e.g.,a movable object or a person). Thus:

Pumunta siya ng opisina.
‘He went to the/an office.’

occurs as an alternant of:
Pumunta siya sa opisina.

but mg cannot replace sa in cases such as the following:

opisina niya.

bagong opisina.
Pumunta siya sa

eroplano.

Nanay.

his office.”
the/a new office.”
‘He went to

the/an airplane.’
Mother.’

Some further examples of alternation between ng-phrase and sa-phrase directional complements are:

ng

Bumalik siya Maynila,
sa

‘He returned to Manila.’

ng

Pumasok siya silid.
sa

‘He entered the/a room’

ng

Umakyat siya puno.
sa

‘He climbed the/a tree.”

§5.26. Verb adjuncts.

As is noted in §5.6, certain intransitive verbs occur with adjuncts, The adjuncts are structures of
various types that occur in a non-focus relation to the verb. Some adjuncts are similar in form and/or
meaning to the complements of transitive verbs. The adjuncts differ from the complements, however, in
that they do not directly correspond to the topic of a related verb formed with the same base. (For a
discussion of the correspondence between complements and topics of related transitive verbs, cf. §§2.9
and 5.1.) Other adjuncts are similar to components of compound or phrasal bases (cf. §5.18, subsections
(3) and (4)), but differ from these base components in that they may be separated from the verb.

Intransitive verbs that accept adjuncts may be divided into three classes on the basis of the types of
adjuncts they accept: PSEUDO-TRANSITIVE (PT) VERBS, ADJUNCTIVE (A) VERBS, and
ADJUNCTIVE PSEUDO-TRANSITIVE (APT) VERBS. A PT verb is one that accepts an ACTOR
ADJUNCT only; and A verb is one that accepts some one adjunct that is not an actor adjunct; and an APT
verb is one that accepts both an actor adjunct and an adjunct of some other type.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 385

The actor adjunct is a structure that is similar in form and meaning to the actor complement that
occurs with a GF (goal—focus) transitive verb (cf. §5.25): iLe., it is normally expressed by ang phrase, and
it designates the performer of the action. But while, for every sentence involving an actor complement of a
GF transitive verb there is an exactly corresponding sentence involving the actor topic of an AF verb
formed with the same base, for sentences with actor adjuncts no such exactly corresponding sentence
occurs. Thus, for example, the actor complement (ni Rosa) in the sentence:

Kinawayan ni Rosa ang kaibigan niya.
‘Rosa waved to her friend.’

corresponds exactly to the actor topic (si Rosa) in:

Kumaway si Rosa sa kaibigan niya.
‘Rosa waved to her friend.”

But no such correspondence can be found between the actor adjunct (71/ Rosa) in the sentence:

Ikinaway ni Rosa ang kanang kamay niya.
‘Rosa waved her right hand.’

and the topic of a related sentence with si Rosa serving as the actor topic of an AF verb formed with the
base Kaway. (That is, while the GF transitive verb kawayan (perfective: Kinawayan) has an exact AF
counterpart kumaway (perfective: kwmaway) the pseudo-transitive verb ikaway (perfective: ikinaway)
lacks such a counterpart, there being no “magkaway; and kumaway being the AF counterpart of kKawayan
rather than ikaway. It would be possible to classify verbs like ikaway as defective transitive verbs — i.¢., GF
transitive verbs whose AF counterparts happen not to be in use — rather than as PT intransitive verbs, but
the latter treatment of these verbs seems on the whole preferable.)

The various types of adjuncts that occur with A verbs, and the types, in addition to actor adjuncts,
that occur with APT verbs may be subdivided, on the bases of form, into: adjuncts introduced by ng;
adjuncts introduced by sa; and adjuncts introduced by the linker na/-ng. Within each of these classes certain
further subdivisions can be made on the basis of form, meaning, or the relation of the adjuncts to structures
that occur in other contexts.

In the following presentation, verbs that accept adjuncts are arranged into classes on the basis of the
types of adjuncts they accept and the affixes with which they are formed. Wherever possible, four examples
are given for each class. If fewer than four examples are given, the listed verbs may be the only members of
the class. (There are a few transitive verbs that accept adjuncts in addition to complement. These are
presented at the end of the section, under IV.)

I. | PT CLASSES. The following classes of verbs accept actor adjuncts only.
1. -an classes
a. Verbs whose bases also occur as bases of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3):

bagalan ‘make slow’ (cf, mabagal ‘slow’)
paitan ‘make bitter’ (cf. mapait ‘bitter’)
tamisan ‘make sweet (cf. matamis ‘sweet’)
tapangan ‘make strong’ (cf. matapang ‘strong’)

Bagalan mo ang lakad mo.
‘Walk slowly.’ (Literally: ‘Make your walking slow.’)

abutan ‘find (upon arrival)’
datnan ‘find (upon arrival)’
iw(an)an ‘abandon’
tandaan ‘remember’

Inabutan ko siya sa opisina.
‘I found him in the office (upon my arrival).’

As members of this class, abutan, datnan, and iw/an jan are normally followed by locative
adverbs as well as actor adjuncts. (These three verbs also occur as APT verbs — cf.
IIT.C.1.b, below.)

2. éelass

ikaway ‘wave (the hand)’

igalaw ‘move (a part of the body)’
ilakad ‘put in a walking motion’
iyuko ‘bow (the head)’

Ikaway mo ang kanang kamay mo.
‘Wave your right hand.”

Most of the verbs in this class express the movement of a part of the body.
3. -in class

agarin ‘do without delay’
araw-arawin ‘do every day’

datnin ‘find (upon arrival)’
isa-isahin ‘sort through one by one’

Agarin mo ang kampanya.

‘Campaign without delay.’

(Literally: ‘Do the campaigning without delay.’)

( Dating also occurs as the base of a PT -a verb of identical
meaning — cf. I.1.b, above.)

II. A CLASSES. The following classes of verbs accept some one adjunct that is not an actor

adjunct.
A. Verbs with adjuncts introduced by ng

kulangin ‘run short of (cf, kulang ‘short of")

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 387

Kinapos ako ng pera.
‘Tran short of money.”

The ng phrases that occur as adjuncts with these verbs correspond to those
that occur as complements with the adjectives (cf. §4.17, subsection

(3): eg.,

kapos ng pera ‘short of money.”

b. Verbs whose bases express an ‘attack’ or ‘fit’

atakihin ‘have an attack of” (cf. atake ‘attack’)
sasalin ‘have a fit of” (cf. sasal ‘fit’)
sumpungin ‘have an attack of (cf. sumpong ‘attack’)

Inatake ng malarya si Juan.
‘Juan had an attack of malaria.’

In the case of atakihin and sumpungin (but apparently not that of sasalin) the
ng phrases that occur as adjuncts correspond to ng phrases of specification
(cf. §3.23) that occur with the base nouns: e.g.,

atake ng malarya ‘attack of malaria.”

c. Verbs whose bases express times of day

gabihin ‘not do ... until night’ (cf. gabi ‘night’)

hatinggabihin ‘not do . . . until midnight’ (cf. hatinggabi ‘midnight’)
tanghaliin ‘not do .. . until mid-day (cf. tanghali ‘mid-day’)
umagahin ‘not do . . . until morning’ (cf. umaga ‘morning’)

alis.
Ginabi kami ng
pag-alis.
‘We left late.’ (Literally: ‘We didn’t leave until night.’)

The adjunct that occurs with these verbs is of the shape ng plus nominalized
verb base (cf. §3.27) or gerund (cf. §3.26).

3. Ma class

‘ ‘He walked slowly.’ (Literally: ‘He was slow in walking.’)

Verbs whose bases also occur as ika- ordinal numbers (cf. §4.4)

mag-ikalawa ‘be the second (of), be two o’clock (in)’ (cf. ikalawa ‘second’)
mag-ikalima ‘be the fifth (of), be five o’clock (in)’ (cf. ikalima ‘fifth’)
mag-ikalabindalawa ‘be the twelfth (of), be twelve o’clock (in) (cf.
ikalabindalawa ‘twelfth’)

‘twenty—first’)

Disyembre.

The adjuncts are the same mg phrases that occur after the ordinal numbers in
dates and expressions of clock time (cf. §4.4, subsections (2) and (6)).

Others
magkahalaga ‘be valued at’

Nagkakahalaga ng sandaang piso ito.
‘This is valued at one hundred pesos.”

The adjunct is of the shape ng plus an expression of cost (cf. §4.4, subsection

panaktan ‘have a pain in”
panghinaan ‘feel weakness in’

Pinamulahan ng bisig ang maysakit.
‘The invalid had a reddening of the arms.’

Apparently all the bases that occur in verbs of this class also occur in intransitive
mang- verbs (cf. §5.6, class H) that do not accept a complement: e.g.,

mamula ‘redden,’ manakit ‘have a pain.”

7. -um classes

a. Verbs whose bases also occur as unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2)

bumukod ‘be at/in a separate ..., do... separately’ (cf. bukod ‘separate’)
humiwalay ‘be at/in a separate ... , do. . . separately’ (cf. hiwalay ‘separate’)

bahay
Bubukod ng {iain ang bagong-kasal.
l pagkain

j be at/in a separate house.”
‘The newly—weds will

l eat separately.’

The ng phrases that occur as adjuncts with these verbs correspond to those
that occur as complements with the adjective (cf. §4.17, subsection (3)).
Thus burmukod ang humiwalay take adjuncts of the shape ng plus unmarked
noun, nominalized verb base, or gerund.

b. Others

sukat ‘measure’

tumimbang ‘weigh’

Sumusukat ng tatlong ektarya ang lupa.

maanghangan ‘find . . . biting in taste’
maalatan ‘find .. . salty’

mainitan ‘find .. . hot’

malamigan ‘find... cold’

Naanghangan siya sa sili,
‘He found the pepper biting in taste.”

The bases that occur in this class also occur as bases of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3);
thus: saanghang ‘biting in taste,’ maalat ‘salty,’ etc. Some of the verbs are
homonymous with simple intransitive verbs that occur without adjuncts (cf. §5.6,
class E). Thus mainitan and malamigan also occur as simple intransitive verbs,
meaning, respectively, ‘feel hot’ and ‘feel cold.

maka- class

makasulit ‘pass’
Nakasulit siya sa iksamen.
‘He passed in the examination."

dumami ‘be greater/more than’
sumobra ‘be greater/more than’
tumaas ‘be higher/more than’

Hindi bababa sa sampung piso ang halaga niyan.
‘The value of that will not be less than ten pesos.’

The bases of many of these verbs also occur in ma- adjectives. The adjuncts that
accompany the verbs correspond to sa phrases in comparisons of inequality

involving the adjectives (cf. §4.15): e.g., mas mababa (kay }sa sampung piso ‘less !
than ten pesos*

C. Verbs with adjuncts introduced by na/-ng

In most cases A-verb adjuncts introduced by na/-ng include the basic form of a verb

(cf. §2.8). AF basic forms may be accompanied by any complements the verb accepts.
GF basic forms may be accompanied by a topic and by any complements the verb accepts
other than an actor complement. Compare the adjuncts (na/-ng bumili...., na/-ng

bilkin ... in:

Manuel na ) bumili ng kotse.
Natukso si
Beng j bilhin ang kotse.
‘Manuel ) a }
was tempted to buy car.”

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 391

and the sentences:

Bumili ng kotse si Manuel/Ben.
‘Manuel/Ben bought a car.”

Binili ni Manuel/Ben ang kotse.
‘Manuel/Ben bought the car.’

If the basic form in the adjunct is AF, and the topic of the A verb is not an enclitic
pronoun, the topic may occur either before the linker or after the basic form or its
complement(s). Thus, also:

Natuksong bumili ng kotse si Manuel/Ben.
‘Manuel/Ben was tempted to buy a car,’

If the basic form in the adjunct is GF, or if the basic form is AF and the topic is an
enclitic pronoun, the topic always precedes the linker.

(Constructions involving na/-ng plus an adjunct that includes a basic form are often
similar in shape to constructions involving nominalized basic forms (cf. §3.25) or
imperative nominal clauses. In the case of nominalized basic forms, the introductory
linker is usually -ng rather than na/-ng, and the basic—form construction occurs as an
expansion of a nominal; often there is also alternation betwcen the linker and the topic
marker ang. For a discussion of imperative nominal clauses, cf. §3.28, subsection (2).)

Naj-ng also introduces certain adjuncts that do not include the basic form of a verb.
In the presentation that follows, it is to be understood, unless otherwise specified, that
the occurring adjuncts involve a basic form.

The adjunct introduced by na/-ng includes an inflected form of a verb. (The bases that
form most of the verbs in this class also occur in maka-/ma- object verbs of related
meaning — cf. §5.3, class B.1. No exact maka- verb counterpart, however, occurs for the
ma- verbs followed by adjuncts.)
IV. TRANSITIVE VERBS THAT ACCEPT ADJUNCTS. There are at least five transitive verbs that
accept adjuncts in addition to their regular complements. Four of these are object verbs meaning
‘invite’: viz., kumumbida/kumbidahin, mag-anyaya/anyayahan, mag-imbitafimbitahin, yumayafyaya-
in. The fifth is the directional verb sumabay/sabayan ‘do togwther with.”

The adjuncts that occur with verbs meaning ‘invite’ are introduced by the linker na/-ng and
include the basic form of a verb (cf. discussion under HU, above, for details of the formation of

basic—form adjuncts). Examples are:

kumumbida

nag-anyaya } tumikim nito.
Ako ang sa dalagang

nag-imbita tikman ito.

yumaya

‘It was I who invited the girl to taste this.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
396 CHAPTER S$

Kinumbida

Inanyayahan j tumikim nito.
ko ang dalagang

Inimbita | tikman ito.

Niyaya

‘L invited the girl to taste this.”

The AF verbs in this group accept adjuncts only where they occur in nominalized position (cf.
§3.24), and only when their object complements are expressed by sa phrases. Thus, while there are
sentences like:

Kumumbida ako ng dalaga.
‘Linvited a girl.”

and

Ako ang kumumbida ng dalaga.
‘It was I who invited a girl.”

there is no:

*Kumumbida ako ng/sa dalagang tumikim nito.

or:
*Ako ang kumumbida ng dalagang tumikim nito.

Adjuncts that occur with sumabay/sabayan are of the shape ng plus a gerund or a nominalized
verb base. Examples are:

Sumabay ako sa kanila pagkain.
ng

Sinabayan ko sila kain.

‘Late together with them."

§5.27. Maging constructions.

AMAGING CONSTRUCTION consists of a form of the verb maging /magin/ plus an unmarked noun,
an adjective, or an expansion of an unmarked noun or adjective. MAGING CONSTRUCTIONS are usually
translatable by ‘become’ constructions in English.

Maging is similar to the verbal prefixes in being obligatorily non-pre-enclitic (i.¢., it is never
immediately followed by an enclitic particle or pronoun — cf. § §3.29 and 6.6), and is sometimes written as
a prefix in conventional spelling. Thus the Tagalog equivalent of, for example, ‘become president’ is
sometime spelled maging-presidente, sometimes maging presidente. Analytically, it seems on the whole
preferable to regard maging as an independent verb rather than as a prefix, in view of the fact that it may
occur as one of the two components of a construction whose other component is not a base, but, rather, an
expanded construction: e.g.,

maging unang presidente ng samahan
‘become the first president of the organization’

maging pinakamabuting presidente sa Jahat
‘become the best president of all’
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 397

Maging is actor—focus, and is inflected for aspect like other actor—focus verbs: i.e., it occurs in a
recent—perfective form (cf. §5.23), as well as in forms marked for the three basic aspects. The
aspect—marked forms of maging are:

contemplated: magiging {magi'gin/
imperfective: nagiging /nagi-gin/
perfective: nagiging /nagi*gin/
recent—perfective: kapagiging /kapagi-gin/

Examples in sentences are:

Magiging
Nagiging mayamang-mayaman sila.
Naging

will become )

‘They | are becoming very rich.”
became {

Kapagiging sarhento pa lang ng anak ko.
‘My son has just become a sergeant.”

Maging has a pluralized form, mangagiging, marked by the infix -nga- (cf. §5.15):

Nangagiging mahal ang mga kamatis.
‘Tomatoes are becoming expensive.’

There are also two gerunds (cf. §3.26) that correspond to maging: the aspectless gerund pagiging /pagi-gin/
and the perfective gerund pag(ka )kapaging /pag(ka)ka‘ pagin/:

Pagiging
Ikinatuwa ko ang presidente niya.
pag(ka)kapaging
{ becoming )
‘His president made me happy.”
| having become|

Finally, there is a causative—focus verb derived from maging: ifka}paging /i(ka)pagin/. (For some speakers

ipaging is the preferred form; for others ipaging and ikapaging are free alternants.) An example of the use of
the causative—focus verb is:

Ipinaging/Ikinapaging mahal ng bigas ang nakaraang bagyo.
‘The recent typhoon caused rice to become expensive.”

(cf. Naging mahal ang bigas dahil sa nakaraang bagyo.
‘Rice became expensive because of the recent typhoon.”)

(As is the case with other causative—focus verbs (cf. §5.8), i(ka)paging takes an actor complement that
corresponds to the topic of the related actor—focus verb.)

§5.28. Intensive—repetitive verbal constructions.

Any verb, whether major or derived, that expresses an action capable of intensive, repeated, or
prolonged performance, may occur in an INTENSIVE- REPETITIVE CONSTRUCTION expressing such a
performance of the action. The construction consists of two occurrences of the verb linked by the particle
nang {nan/. Both structurally and semantically, the construction is similar to the English construction in
which two occurrences of a verb are linked by ‘and’. Thus:

Tumawa nang tumawa si Juan.
‘Juan laughed and laughed.”

Siya ang sinulatan nang sinulatan ni Pedro.
‘She’s the one that Pedro writes and writes to.’

Papagtatrabahuhin nang papagtatrabahuhin ni Miss Reyes ang mga bata.
‘Miss Reyes will make the children work and work.’

The construction may also be translated by an English construction of the shape ‘keep —_ing,’ or by a vetb
followed by an expression such as ‘a lot,’ ‘continually,’ repeatedly,’ etc.

The verbs that may occur in an intensive—repetitive construction include the various intensive verb
formations presented in §5.16, subsection (1). Some examples are:

Nag-iiyak nang nag-iiyak ang babae.
‘The woman kept weeping bitterly.’

(cf. Nag-iiyak ang babae.
‘The woman wept bitterly.’)

Pinagsusuntok nang pinagsusuntok ng mga bantay ang bilanggo.
‘The guards kept punching and punching the prisoner.”

(cf. Pinagsusuntok ng mga bantay ang bilanggo.
‘The guards kept punching the prisoner.’ )

Any enclitic pronoun(s) and/or particle(s) (cf. §§3.29 and 6.2 ff.) present in a sentence with an
intensive—repetitive construction in predicate position occur between the first verb and the particle nang.
Thus:

Tumakbo siya nang tumakbo.
‘He ran and ran.”

Nag-aaral daw naman nang nag-aaral si Joe.
‘They say that Joe, on the other hand, studies and studies.”

In the case of intensive—repetitive construction with imperfective—aspect actor—focus verbs, the
verbal affixes and aspect markers are often optionally deletable. The resultant contracted construction,
which has the shape base + nang + base, is identical in meaning with the full intensive—repetitive
construction from which it is derived. Examples are:

Lakad nang lakad ang kartero.
‘The postman walks and walks.’

(cf. Lumalakad nang lumalakad ang kartero.
‘The postman walks and walks.’)

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 399

Luto lamang nang luto si Rosa.
‘Rosa just cooks and cooks.’

(cf. Nagluluto lamang nang nagluluto si Rosa,
‘Rosa just cooks and cooks.’)

Verb bases that may occur in this contracted intensive—repetitive construction include most -wm- and mag-
verb bases that themselves have an ‘action’ meaning (e.g., lakad ‘walk’ and luto ‘cook’ in the examples
above), and a limited number of -um-, mag-, and mang- verb bases that do not themselves have an action
meaning (e.g., haba ‘length, the base of humaba ‘become long(er), lengthen’; bago ‘new,’ the base of
magbago ‘change’; anak ‘child, the base of manganak ‘give birth.”)

Certain actor—focus indirect—action verbs (cf. §5.12, subsection (1)) occurring in an intensive—repet-
itive construction may also undergo contraction, In this case, the indirect—action prefix pa- is retained
together with the verb base, so that the construction has the shape: pa- + base + nang + pa- + base.
Examples are:

Palinis nang palinis ng bahay sa akin ang Nanay.
‘Mother makes me clean and clean the house.”

(cf. Nagpapalinis nang nagpapalinis ng bahay sa akin ang Nanay.”
‘Mother makes me clean and clean the house.")

Pakain sila nang pakain ng kendi sa kanila.
‘They let them eat and eat candy.”

(cf. Nagpapakain sila nang nagpapakain ng kendi sa kanila.
‘They let them eat and eat candy.”)

§5.29. Possessive and existential verbal construction.

Possessive and existential verbal constructions are similar in both form and meaning to possessive and
existential adjectival phrases of the shape may plus nominal or mayroon plus linker (-ng) plus nominal. (The
may and mayroon constructions occur as alternants in most contexts — cf. §§4.22 and 4.23.) The formal
differences between the adjectival and verbal structures may be described as follows:

(1) If the adjectival phrase is of the shape may plus nominal, the corresponding verbal construction
shows, in place of may, and aspect—marked form of the verbal prefix magka- /magka/. (Verbs formed with
magka- are inflected for aspect like other verbs formed with prefixes beginning with /m/— cf. §5.22.)
Compare, for example:

May pera si Juan.
‘Juan has/had some money.”

May giyera sa Europa.
‘There is/was a war in Europe.”

and, respectively:

Magkakapera )
Nagkakapera | si Juan.

Nagkapera

will come
‘Juan is coming to have some money.’

400 CHAPTER 5

Magkakagyera )
Nagkakagyera ; sa Europa.
Nagkagyera j

{ will be )
‘There is a war (developing) in Europe.’
[me |

(2) If the adjectival phrase is of the shape mayrvon plus -ng plus nominal, the corresponding verbal
construction shows: (a) in place of the may of mayroon, an aspect—marked form of magka-;(b) in place of
-ng, the marker ng /nan/. Compare, for example:

Mayroong pera si Juan.
Mayroong giyera sa Europa.

and, respectively:

Magkakaroon )
Nagkakaroon ng pera si Juan.
Nagkaroon {

Magkakaroon
Nagkakaroon ng giyera sa Europa.
Nagkaroon

(Translations are the same as for the corresponding sentences given under (1), above.)

Apart from the replacement of may by a form of magka- and of the linker -ng by the marker ng, there
are no other formal differences between the adjectival and verbal constructions, Thus, sentences with
possessive verbal predicates, like those with possessive adjectival predicates, have the usual
predicate—plus—topic structure, while sentences with existential verbal predicates, like those with
existential adjectival predicates are topicless.

The differences in meaning between the adjectival and verbal structures are: (1) the adjectival
structures are unspecific with respect to aspect, while the verbal structures are specific; (2) the adjectival
Structures express a state (of ‘possession’ or ‘existence’), while the verbal structures express the
development of such a state. (The English equivalents of sentences with possessive verbal predicates often
involve a form of ‘come to have,’ ‘acquire,’ or ‘get’; the English equivalents of sentences with existential
verbal predicates often involve ‘there is, ctc .... developing,’ ‘there is, etc . . . getting started,” or a form of
‘occur’.)

In some cases there are verbal constructions formally related to possessive or existential phrases with
mayroon but no corresponding constructions formally related to phrases with may. While, for example,
there are verbal constructions related to phrases of the shape mayroon plus linker plus modified noun, there
are none related to phrases of the shape may plus modified noun. Thus there are sentences like:

Magkakaroon ng perang Amerikano si Juan.
‘Juan will come to have some American money.”

(cf. Mayroong perang Amerikano si Juan.
‘Juan has had some American money.’)

but there is no:

*Magkakaperang Amerikano si Juan.
(cf. May perang Amerikano si Juan.)

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

401

And, while there are, in general, verbal constructions related to all existential phrases with mayroon, verbal
constructions related to existential phrases with may are limited to those cases in which the noun that
follows may designates an event —e.g., nouns such as giyera ‘war,’ aksidente ‘accident,’ handaan ‘party,’

laro ‘game,’ pulong ‘meeting.’ Thus there are sentences lik:

Nagkakaroon ng prutas sa puno.
‘There is fruit (developing) on the tree.”

(cf. Mayroong prutas sa puno.
‘There is/was fruit on the tree.”)

but there is no:

*Nagkakaprutas sa puno.
(cf. May prutas sa puno.)

Some further examples of possessive verbal constructions are:

Magkakakasama }
ang bawa’t isa.

Magkakaroon ng kasama

‘Each one will get a partner.’

Nagkakalupa }
ang pamilya niya.

Nagkakaroon ng lupa j

‘His family is acquiring land.”

me din sila.
Nagkaroon din sila ng pera.
‘They came to have money too.”

(As the last example illustrates, the position of enclitic particles and pronouns in verbal constructions
telated to phrases with may and mayroon corresponds to their position in the related adjectival

Structures: cf.

(ye pera din sila.
Mayroon din silang pera.

‘They have/had money too.’)

Some further examples of existential verbal constructions are:

Magkakahandaan ba )

mamayang gabi?
Magkakaroon ba ng en
‘Will there be a party (occurring) tonight?’
Nagkakapulong na }

sa opisina ng prinsipal.
Nagkakaroon na ng pulong

Nagkaaksidente

Nagkaroon ng aksidente

‘An accident occurred here yesterday.”

§5.30. Imperative, hortative, and optative constructions.

An IMPERATIVE CONSTRUCTION expresses a command or a request. Tagalog has imperative
constructions of five types, which may be called: the BASIC IMPERATIVE, the EQUATIONAL
IMPERATIVE, the IMMEDIATE IMPERATIVE, the ABBREVIATED IMPERATIVE, and the HABITUAL
IMPERATIVE, (There are also a few fixed imperative expressions that are not of these types: e¢.g.,
Halika(yo) ‘Come here,’ Madali kafyo) ‘Hurry up,’ Tuloy kafyo) ‘Come in’; the forms ending in ka are
singular, those in kayo plural.)

The basic imperative is produced by eliminating the aspect marker (cf. §§5.19 through 5.21) from
the predicate verb of a narrational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor. When the aspect
marker is thus eliminated, the basic form of the verb remains. (As is explained in §2.8, the basic form of a
verb consists of a verb base and the basic form of an affix.) To illustrate:

Narrational Imperative
Wawalisan
Winawalisan mo ang sahig. > Walisan mo ang sahig.
Winalisan
will sweep )
*You are sweeping the floor.” > ‘Sweep the floor.’
swept {

(In the illustration, the aspect marker of the narrational—sentence verbs is double—underscored, and the
basic form of the verb is single—-underscored. As the illustration shows, it is the basic form — consisting, in
this case, of the base walis and the suffix -a/- that occurs in the imperative construction.)

In the Tagalog basic imperative, the second—person—pronoun actor is explicitly expressed. In English
imperatives, on the other hand, the explicit subject is not usually present. (The subject ‘you,’ however, may
occur with an emphatic or contrastive meaning: e.g., ‘You finish the cake. (I’m too full.).’ See below for
the Tagalog equivalent of such constructions.)

Not every narrational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor may be converted into
a basic imperative. Certain verbs — e.g., those that include the ability and involuntary—action affixes maka-,
mta-, etc. (cf. §5.13)—do not normally occur in imperative constructions, their meanings being
incompatible with the expression of a command,

Some examples of basic imperative constructions are presented below. The examples represent a
variety of verbal affixes and focuses.

Kumain ka.
‘Eat.’

Maghintay kayo.
‘Wait.’

Manghiram ka ng pera.
“Borrow some money.”

Matulog kayo rito.
‘Sleep here.”

Magpaluto ka ng pagkain.
‘Have some food cooked.”

Basahin mo rin ito.
‘Read this too.”

Ibigay ninyo ito sa kanila.
‘Give this to them."

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 403

Lagyan mo ng asin ang sabaw.
‘Put some salt in the soup.”

Isulat mo ako sa Nanay.
‘Write to Mother for me.”

Ipansimba ninyo ang mga iyon.
‘Wear those to church,’

(The initial sa-pronoun actor complement, discussed in §5.25, subsection (1), may occur in a
goal—focus imperative construction, as in goal~focus constructions of other types. Thus:

Iyo ding basahin

ito.
Basahin mo rin
‘Read this too.’)

The equational imperative is produced by eliminating the aspect marker from the nominalized topic
verb (cf. §3.24) of an equational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor. For example:

Equational Imperative
Ito ang BAbasahin mo. Ito ang basahin mo.
‘This is what you'll read.” “Read this,"

In the equational imperative, the element (usually a noun or pronoun) that occurs in predicate position is
emphasized. Compare:

Basic imperative: Basahin mo ito.
‘Read this.’

Equational imperative: Tto ang basahin mo.
‘Read this.”

When the topic verb of an equational imperative is actor-focus, the emphasized predicate is the
second—person—pronoun that expresses the actor. This type of equational imperative is translatable by an
English imperative with the subject you explicitly expressed: e.g.,

Ikaw ang umubos ng keyk. (Masyado akong busog, e.)
“You finish the cake. (I’m too full.)’

The immediate imperative is used to command (or request — sce below) the immediate performance
of an action. An immediate—imperative construction consists of an unaffixed verb base, plus, optionally,
one or more enclitic particles (notably na ‘now’), and lacks any explicit expression of the actor. Not all verb
bases occur in the immediate imperative construction. The bases that do occur in the construction are
roughly the same as those ‘action’ bases that may be nominalized (cf. §3.27). In the immediate imperative,

however, the base is never accompanied by any complement(s). Some examples of the immediate
imperative are:

Alis (na)! Bili (na)!

“Leave!” “Buy (some).’

Inom (na)! Luto (na)!

‘Drink!’ ‘Cook (something).”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
404 CHAPTER 5

Kuha (na)! Tanong (na)!
‘Get (some)! “Ask!”

Lakad (na)! Tulog (na)!
‘Go!’ ‘Sleep!’

The abbreviated imperative is derived from a basic imperative that includes a predicate
secondary—actor—focus (A2F) indirect—action verb formed with pa-. .. in (cf. §5.12, subsection (2)) and
a first—person—pronoun topic (ako or kami): e.g.,

Painumin mo/ninyo ako/kami ng tubig.
‘Let me/us have some water.’

In the abbreviated imperative, the suffix -in (of the A2F verb) and the actor complement are deleted,
and the topic is optionally deleted. Thus the abbreviated imperative derived from the basic imperative given
above is:

Painom (ako/kami) ng tubig.
“Let me/us have some water.”

(When the topic is deleted in an abbreviated—imperative construction, either a singular or a plural
first-person topic may be understood.)

Some further examples are:

Paupo (ako/kami) dito.
‘Let me/us sit here.”
(cf. Paupuin mo/ninyo ako/kami dito.)

Pahiram (ako/kami) ng makinilyang iyon.
‘Let me/us borrow that typewriter.’
(cf. Pahiramin mo/ninyo ako/kami ng makinilyang iyon.)

(A2F verbs formed with papag-...-in and papang-...-in do not occur in abbreviated imperative
constructions. As is noted in §5.12, subsection (2), papag-...-in and papang-...-in A2F verbs are
derived, respectively, from mag- and mang- verbs, while pa-... -in A2F verbs are derived from -tm- or ma-
verbs.)

The habitual imperative is derived from a basic or equational imperative by replacing the basic form
of the verb with the contemplated—aspect form. The habitual imperative expresses a demand or request for
habitual or regular action: c.g.,

Mag-aaral ka ng liksyon mo.
‘Study your lessons (regularly).’

(cf. Mag-aral ka ng liksyon mo.
“Study your lesson(s).’)

Ito ang gagawin mo.
‘Do this (regularly).”

(cf. Ito ang gawin mo.
‘Do this.’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 405

(When the meaning of habitual or regular action is expressed explicitly elsewhere in the sentence, this
meaning may be redundantly expressed through the use of a habitual imperative. In such cases, the habitual
imperative alternates freely with the underlying basic or equational imperative: e.g.,

Mageaaral

ka ng liksyon mo gabi-gabi.
Mag-aral \
“Study your lessons every night.’)

(In the case of at least one verb, mag-ingat ‘be careful’ the contemplated—aspect form alternates
freely with the basic form in imperative constructions, and does not necessarily imply habitual or regular
action: e.g.,

Mag-iingat

ka ngayon.
Mag-ingat
‘Be careful now.’)

Any one of the five types of imperatives described above is changed from a command to a polite
request (equivalent to an English imperative with ‘please’) by the inclusion in the sentence of the enclitic
particle nga (cf. §6.4, subsection (b)): ¢.g.,

Kumain ka nga.
‘Please eat.”

Ikaw nga ang umubos ng keyk.
“You please finish the cake.”

Alis (na) nga!
‘Please leave!”

Painom nga ng tubig.
‘Please let me/us have a drink of water.”

Mag-aaral ka nga ng liksyon mo.
‘Please study your lessons (regularly).”

In the case of basic, abbreviated, and habitual imperatives, politeness may also be expressed by the use of
the enclitic particle naman — which, however, usually conveys a meaning of mild reproach or complaint in
addition to that of politeness. For example:

Kumain ka naman.
‘Please eat. (I'll be hurt if you don’t.)

Tulungan mo naman ako,
‘Please help me. (Don’t just sit there.)’

Paupo naman dito.
‘Please let me/us sit here. (Can’t you see I’m/we’re tired?)’

Mag-aaral ka naman ng liksyon mo.
‘Please study your lessons (regularly). (Why do I have to keep asking you?)*

CHAPTER §

Politeness is also expressed by the use of two special request prefixes, maki- and paki-, which cither
teplace or occur in addition to the verbal affix of a basic imperative sentence. Maki- is actor—focus, and
replaces -ain- or mag-. (Mang-, ma-, and maka- actor—focus verbs do not accept the request prefix maki.)
Paki- is goal—focus. It occurs in addition to -an, &, -in, or a complex affix that includes one of these. In
formations that include the request prefix paki-, & is optionally deletable in all cases, and -in is optionally
deletable if it is the only affix in the underlying form: i.e., if the underlying affix is not complex. The
correspondences between the request affixes and the affixes that underlie them are summarized in Chart
22. (The symbol X is used in the chart to represent any affix in addition to the one specified.)

Nga occurs optionally after polite formations with maki- and paki-, increasing the politeness

are:

Command

‘Go to the market.’

Magluto ka ng tinapay.
‘Bake some bread.”

Magpabili ka ng tinapay.
‘Have (someone) buy some bread.”

Hingan mo siya ng piso.
‘Ask him for a peso.”

Pasulatan mo ako kay Ben,
‘Have Ben write to me.’

Iabot mo ang asin.
‘Pass the salt.’

Ipanghiwa mo ito ng karne.
‘Cut some meat with this.’

Linisin mo ang bahay.
‘Clean the house.’

Papag-aralin mo ang bata.
“Let the child study.”

Request
Makipunta ka (nga) sa palengke.
‘Please go to the market.’

Makiluto ka (nga) ng tinapay.
‘Please bake some bread.”

Makipabili ka (nga) ng tinapay.
‘Please have (someone) buy some bread.”

Pakihingan mo (nga) siya ng piso.
‘Please ask him for a peso.”

Pakipasulatan mo (nga) ako kay Ben.
‘Please have Ben write to me.”

(t)pakiabot mo (nga) ang asin.
‘Please pass the salt.”

(I)pakipanghiwa mo (nga) ito ng karne.
‘Please cut some meat with this.”

Pakilinis(in) mo (nga) ang bahay.
‘Please clean the house.’

Pakipapag-aralin mo (nga) ang bata.
‘Please let the child study.”

(It may be noted that maki- plus the base of an -wm- verb is ambiguous, since maki- in such a context may
be interpreted as either the basic form of the social—verb prefix maki- — cf. §5.14 — or the request prefix.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 407

Thus makipunta may mean either ‘go with’ or ‘please go.’ In the case of mag- bases, on the other hand,
there is no ambiguity, since the social—verb prefix that occurs with a mag- base is makipag- while the
request prefix that occurs with such a base is maki-. Thus: makipagluto ‘cook with’ but makiluto ‘please
cook.’)

A HORTATIVE CONSTRUCTION expresses the speaker’s wish that he and the person(s) addressed
perform some action, Hortative constructions are equivalent to English constructions introduced by
‘let’s: e.g., ‘Let’s eat.” Tagalog has two hortative constructions: the BASIC HORTATIVE and the
EQUATIONAL HORTATIVE., Like the basic imperative, the basic hortative has the basic form of a verb in
predicate position. Like the equational imperative, the equational hortative has the basic form of a verb in
topic position. In the hortative constructions, however, the performer of the action is expressed by a dual
plural (inclusive first-person plural) pronoun, rather than the second—person pronoun of the imperative
constructions. Some examples of basic hortative constructions are:

Kumain tayo.
‘Let’s eat.’

Basahin natin ang librong ito.
‘Let’s read this book.”

Walisan natin ang sahig.
‘Let’s sweep the floor.”

Some examples of equational hortative constructions are:

Tayo ang lumakad.
‘Let's you and me walk.’

lyon ang gawin natin.
‘Let’s do that.”

Ang mga bago ang ipang-iskwela natin.
‘Let’s wear the new ones to school.”

(In addition to basic and equational hortative constructions, Tagalog has at least one fixed expression of
hortative meaning: Tayo na — frequently contracted to Tena — Let’s go.’)

The enclitic particles nga and naman may be used to add a meaning of politeness to hortatives as to
imperatives (see above). Nga is used in this way in both basic and equational hortatives, naman only in basic
hortatives. As in the case of imperatives, naman suggests mild reproach or complaint as well as politeness.
Examples are:

Dalawin nga natin ang Lola.
‘Please, let’s visit Grandmother.’

Tayo nga ang maglinis ng bahay.
‘Let’s you and me clean house, please.’

Umalis naman tayo.
‘Let’s leave, please. (We've stayed long enough.)’

OPTATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS, like hortative constructions, express the speaker’s wish that an
action be performed. In the case of optative constructions, however, the action is to be performed by some
person(s) other than the speaker and the person(s) addressed. There are no productive optative
constructions in English. In place of such constructions English normally uses constructions introduced by
‘I’ plus a verb of optative meaning: e.g., ‘I want him to go,” ‘I hope he wins.’ (English does, however, use
optative constructions in certain fixed phrases: e.g., ‘May the best man win,’ *Long live the King!’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
408 CHAPTER 5

While Tagalog has constructions paralleling the English constructions with ‘I’ plus a verb of optative
meaning (e.g., Gusto Kong pumunta siya ‘1 want him to go,’ Umaasa akong mananalo siya ‘I hope he wins’),
it also has two productive optative constructions: the BASIC OPTATIVE and the EQUATIONAL
OPTATIVE. The basic optative, like the basic imperative and hortative, has the basic form of a verb in
predicate position. The equational optative, like the equational imperative and hortative, has the basic form
of a verb in topic position.

The enclitic particle SANA (cf. §6.5, subsection (e)) is of frequent occurrence in optative
constructions. The inclusion of sana in such a construction changes the meaning of the construction from
the expression of a wish to the expression of a hope. Sana, or one of certain other enclitic particles (see

below), is obligatory in optative constructions in which the actor is expressed by something other than a
third—person pronoun, Thus:

ng katulong
ni Maria
Makita sana ang singsing.
namin
nito

the maid finds
Maria finds
‘l hope the ring.’
we (I and others) find
this one finds

but not:

ng katulong
ni Maria

*Makita ang singsing.
namin

nito

Enclitic particles other than sana that may occur in optative constructions include Kaya, nga
and — for some speakers — ba. These particles differ from one another in meaning, but have in common the
expression of some kind of uncertainty about whether the wished—for action is actually to be performed.
Some examples are:

Tumawag kaya ng duktor ang Tatay.
‘Perhaps Father should call the doctor.”

Dumalaw nga si Manuel sa kaniya (at nang magkausap sila).
‘I would like Manuel to visit him (so that they can talk).”

Tingnan ko nga iyon?
‘May I see that?’

Hugasan ko ba ang pinggan?
‘Should I wash the dishes?’

For some speakers, sana or some other enclitic particle is also obligatory when the actor in an

optative construction is expressed by a third—person pronoun. Other speakers, however, accept such
sentences as:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 409

niya )
Walisan ang sahig.
nila {

{ her )
‘T want to sweep the floor.’

Some further examples of the basic optative construction are:
Mangisda
sila.
Mangisda sana
want them to

‘4 go fishing.”
hope they

Makita sana ni Joe iyan.
‘Lhope Joe sees that.’

Some examples of the equational optative are:

Si Linda
ang piliin niya.
Si Linda sana

( want him to choose )

‘l Linda.”

l hope he chooses {

Ako sana ang yumaman.
‘I hope J get rich.”

Si Rosa sana ang magluto.
‘T hope Rosa does the cooking.’

Adverbials and Their Expansions

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 41

86.1. litéodiiction.

As was noted in §2.14, two major classes of adverbials occur optionally in basic
sentences: ENCLITIC PARTICLES, a class of words that occur only in certain fixed word—order relations
to other sentence elements, and MOVABLE ADVERBS, a class of words and phrases that may occupy any
of several different sentence positions. In addition to these, Tagalog has three other classes of
adverbials: INITIAL ADVERBS, SENTENCE-FINAL PARTICLES, and ADVERBIAL CLAUSES. Initial
adverbs, which may be words or phrases, occur only at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
Sentence—final particles, a small class of words, occur only at the end of a sentence. Adverbial clauses are
distinguished from adverbials of other types by the fact that they have a sentence—like internal structure.

The Tagalog adverbials are presented below as follows: enclitic particles in § §6.2 through 6.6;
movable adverbs in §§6.7 through 6.11; initial adverbs in §6.12; sentence—final particles in §6.13;
adverbial clauses in § §6.14 through 6.18.

§6.2. Enclitic particles: introduction.
Tagalog has cighteen ENCLITIC PARTICLES (or ENCLITIC ADVERBS): viz.,

ba {bah/ na {nah/
kasi /kasih/ naman {naman}
kaya Ikaya’} nga fna’}
daw~raw /daw/~/raw/ pa {pah/
din~tin {din/~/rin{ pala fpalah{
ho {ho’} po !po’}
lamang~lang fla‘man/~/la(+)n/ sana fsa‘nah/
man /man/ tuloy ftuloy/
muna {mu'nah/ yata fya‘ta’}

(Daw and raw are free alternants, as are din and rin, lamang and lang; vowel length in eng is optional.)
From the point of view of the meanings they express (cf. §§6.3—5), the enclitic particles constitute a
rather heterogeneous grouping. They are similar to one another, however, in that they all manifest
ENCLITIC behavior.

As was explained in §3.5, the enclitics of Tagalog are words that, with certain statable exceptions,
obligatorily follow the first word of the construction of which they constitute an immediate part. (Cf. §6.6
for an explanation of IMMEDIATE PART with reference to the enclitic pronouns.) Note, for example, the
differences in sentence position between the enclitic particle na ‘now, any longer’ and the non-enclitic
adverb ngayon ‘today’ in the following sentences:

(1) Naroon na si Rosa.
“Rosa is there now.”

(si Rosa ngayon.
(cf. Naroon

ngayon si Rosa.
‘Rosa is there today.’)

(2) Wala na roon si Rosa.
‘Rosa isn’t there any longer.”

fsi Rosa ngayon.
(cf. Wala roon

ngayon si Rosa.
‘Rosa isn’t there today,’)

412 CHAPTER 6

Na —which is an immediate part of the predicate in these examples — follows the first word of the
predicate in each case, and can occur in no other position: there are no such sentences as *Naroon si Rosa
na, etc. (In Sentence (1), 2a follows the one-—word predicate, naroon; in sentence (2), it comes between the
two words of the negated predicate.) Ngayon on the other hand, shows a range of possible sentence
positions in cach case (cf. §2.18) and while this range in some cases includes a position after the first word
of the predicate (¢.g., Naroon ngayon si Rosa) in other cases it does not (there is no “Wala ngayon roon si
Rosa).

Tagalog has, in addition to enclitic particles, enclitic pronouns (which are presented in detail in
§3.29). When a sentence includes a particle and a pronoun both of which are enclitic to the same word, the
following rules of order obtain:

(1) _ the monosyllabic pronouns ka, ko, and mo precede any enclitic particle(s);
(2) all other enclitic pronouns follow any enclitic particle(s).

Examples of the operation of these rules are:

Kumakain ka na.
“You (sg.) are eating now.’

ako.
siya.
kami.
Kumakain na
tayo.
kayo,
sila.
‘lam
‘He is
‘We are
eating now.’
“We are
‘You (pl.) are
‘They are

Kinakain na ang pagkain.

‘Lam

‘You (sg.) are j

nila
‘He is
‘We are
‘We are eating the food now.”
‘You (pl.) are
‘They are

The rules also apply to sequences of encliti¢s that include two enclitic pronouns and one or more enclitic
particles. Thus:

ka na niya.
Nakikita mo na siya.
ko na siya.
‘He sees you (sg.)
‘You (sg.) see him now.”
‘Lsee him
( niya ako.
Nakikita na namin kayo.
l ninyo sila.
‘He sees me
‘We see you (pl.) now.”
You (pl.) see them

Kita, the composite pronoun that replaces the non-occurring sequence *ko ka, follows any enclitic
particles. Thus:

Nakikita na kita.
‘I see you (sg.) now.”

For rules governing the order of enclitic pronouns relative to one another, cf. §3.29.

When two or more particles are enclitic to the same word, their relative order may be described in
terms of the following order classes:

Class 1: fa, pa

Class 2: man

Class 3(a): ba, din, kasi, ho, lamang, nga, po
(b): daw, muna, naman

Class 4: kaya, pala, sana, tuloy, yata

The two particles that belong to class I never occur in imediate sequence with one another, and are
never preceded by any other enclitic particles. Thus:

na }
Kumain nga kayo.
pa |
{ now.”
‘Please cat

| some more.”
( na
Nagtatrabaho pala kayo roon.
pa

now )

‘So you're working there.”

still j

etc.

4i4 CHAPTER 6

Man, the only particle belonging to class 2, never precedes a particle belonging to class | and never
follows a particle belonging to class 3 or 4. Thus:

Hindi pa man lamang tuloy nakakapag-almusal si Juan.
“As a result, Juan hasn't even had breakfast yet.”

Class 3 is divided into two subclasses on the basis of the behavior of the two subclasses with respect
to particles belonging to class 4. Those class 3 particles listed in subclass 3(a) never follow a class 4 particle;
those listed in subclass 3(b) may follow a class 4 particle (see below).

Two of the class 3 particles, ho and po, never occur in the same sentence. Subject to this restriction,
two or more particles belonging to class 3 may occur in any order relative to one another. There are,
however, certain preferred orderings that obtain within the class. When two or more class 3 particles occur
in sequence, the most common position of any one particle relative to the others is shown in the following
formula:

ho )

nga + din/rin + lamang/lang + daw/raw + + ba + muna + naman + kasi
po |

That is, nga preferably precedes any other class 3 parsticle(s), din preferably precedes any class 3 particle(s)
other than nga lamang preferably precedes any class particle(s) other than nga and din, etc. Some examples
are:

Nagtatrabaho nga rin daw kayo roon.
‘They say it’s true that you’re working there too.’

Nagtatrabaho rin ho ba kayo roon?
‘Are you working there too, sir?’

Nagtatrabaho daw ba naman kayo roon?
‘Do they say that you're working there instead?"

(It should be noted that the relative positions shown in the above formula are merely preferences, and that
other orderings can occur. In a few cases, in fact, some other ordering may be just as common as the one
shown in the formula. For example, when raw(or daw) and ba occur as the only enclitics in a sequence, the
ordering ba raw is quite as normal as the osdering raw ba: c¢.g.,

j ba raw
Nagtatrabaho kayo roon?
raw ba

‘Do they say that you're working there?" )

The particles belonging to class 4 never precede particles belonging to classes 1, 2, and 3(a). They
may, however, precede a particle belonging to class 3(b), although an ordering in which the class 3(b)
particle precedes the class 4 particle is preferred. Thus while both of the following are possible, the first
represents a more common ordering:

j raw kaya
Hindi mabuti iyon,
kaya raw

‘I wonder if they say that's not good.”

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 415

Particles belonging to class 4 may occur in any order relative to one another, but sang preferably

peterets ists t Ir)

follows any of the others, and tuloy preferably follows any of the others except sara. Some examples are:

( yata pala)
Nabili hiya ang damit.
pala yata

‘Oh, I think he got to buy the clothes.”

Nabili kaya tuloy niya ang damit.
‘I wonder if, as a result, he got to buy the clothes.’

Nabili tuloy sana niya ang damit.
‘l hope that it turns out that he got to buy the clothes.’

The meanings and uses of the enclitic particles are presented in §6.3 through 6.5: class | particles in
$6.3; class 2 and class 3 particles in §6.4; class 4 particles in §6.5. The order of enclitic particles in relation
to non-enclitic sentence elements is presented in §6.6.

§6.3. Class 1 enclitic particles.

The two class 1 enclitic particles, na and pa, never occur in immediate sequence with one another.
They may, however, be used in separate clauses of a single sentence (cf. discussion under (7), below), Their
most common uses are the following:

(1) In non-imperative sentences beginning with point—time adverbs expressing future time (cf.
§6.8) —e.g., bukas ‘tomorrow,’ sa Linggo ‘next Sunday,’ sa isang linggo ‘next week’ — na and pa indicate
the speaker’s attitude toward the length of time between the time expressed by the adverb and the moment
of speaking. Pa extends the psychological distance between the two points of time; na reduces it. After
point—time adverbs expressing past time — e.g., Kahapon ‘yesterday,’ noong Linggo ‘last Sunday,’ noong
isang linggo ‘last week’ — pa performs this same function of extending the psychological distance between
the time expressed by the adverb and the moment of speaking; na, however, does not occur after past
point—time adverbs. Examples are:

Sa Linggo pa ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta is next Sunday (and there is plenty of time between now and then).’

Sa Linggo na ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta is next Sunday (and there is little time between now and then).”

Noong Linggo pa ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta was Jast Sunday (and that was quite a while ago).”

(Compare with the above:

s |
Linggo ang piyesta.
Noong {
{ is next
‘The fiesta Sunday.’
was last

These sentences are noncommittal about the speaker’s attitude toward the length of time between the time
expressed by the adverb and the moment of speaking.)

416 CHAPTER 6

(2) In imperative sentences (cf. §5.30) and with predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect, na
denotes immediate initiation or performance of the action, pa continuation or resumption of the action. In
these contexts ia is usually translatable by ‘now,’ pa by ‘some more’ or ‘go on.” Examples are:

j na
Kumain ka
tee
now.”
‘Eat some more,”

or ‘Go on eating.”

{na
linitin ko ang pagkain.
paf

( now.’
‘T’ll heat the food

some more.”
or ‘I'll go on heating the food.”

With predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect, pa may also denote postponement of other actions
in favor of the action expressed by the verb, as in:

Hindi ako makaaalis ngayon; maglalaba pa ako.
‘I can’t leave right now; I still have to do the laundry.”

Mahuhuli ako ng kaunti; patutulugin ko pa ang bata.
‘T ll be a little late; I must put the baby to bed first.’

(3) With predicate verbs in the imperfective aspect and with non-verbal predicates, na suggests that
the situation expressed is a relatively new or altered one, pa that it is a relatively old or continuing one. In
these contexts, na is usually translatable by ‘now’ or ‘already,’ pa by ‘still.’ Examples are:

Nasa bahay | si Rosa.

(=

j now/already

‘Rosa is in the house.”
| still
na
Natutulog ang bata.
pa
j now
‘The child is sleeping.’
l still

(4) With predicate verbs in the perfective aspect, na indicates performance of the action expressed by
the verb at some unspecified time prior to another time. The time prior to which the action is performed

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 417

may be the moment of speaking, in which case the English equivalent often involves ‘has/have’ (plus,
optionally, ‘already’) plus a past participle: e.g.,

Umalis na si Manuel.
‘Manuel has (already) left."

(cf. Umalis si Manuel.
‘Manuel left.")

Or the time prior to which the action is performed may be designated by some past or future point—time
expression. In this case, if the sentence includes a past time expression, the English equivalent usually
involves ‘had’ (plus ‘already’) plus a past participle; if the sentence includes a future time expression, the
English equivalent usually involves ‘will’ (plus ‘already’) plus ‘have’ plus a past participle: e.g.,

Nakarating na si Manuel nang nangyari iyon.
‘Manuel had (already) arsived when it happened.”

Nakarating na si Manuel bago mangyari iyon.
‘Manuel will (already) have arrived when it happens.”
(literally: ‘... before it happens.’)

With predicate verbs in the perfective aspect, pa indicates performance of the action expressed by the
verb in addition to some other action(s), and is usually translatable by English ‘also’ or ‘too’: ¢.g.,

Nagpunta pa ako sa post office.
‘I also went to the post office.’

(cf. Nagpunta ako sa post office.
‘I went to the post office.)

(5) Pa is frequently used with verbs in the recent—perfective aspect (cf. §5.23). The meaning of the
sentence is not affected by the presence or absence of pa: e.g.,

Kaaalis (pa) lamang ni Pedro.
‘Pedro has just left.”

Na does not occur with verbs in the recent—perfective aspect.

(6) Na is often used to indicate a change in some previous plan. This meaning is most frequently
associated with sentences that have nominalized verbal topics (cf. §3.24), or that have an adverb or
complement occurring in initial position in emphatic inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (3)). Pa has no
comparable function.

Ikaw na ang mamili.
‘You'd better do the shopping (e.g., instead of me, as originally planned).”

Bukas ka na umalis.
‘Leave tomorrow (e.g., instead of today).”

Dito ka na matulog ngayong gabi.
‘Sleep here tonight (e.g., instead of going home).’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
418 CHAPTER 6

(7) Pa may be used to express the meaning ‘in addition.” It most frequently occurs in this meaning
after an interrogative word (cf. § §7.7 through 7.11) or a cardinal number (cf. §4.4). With an interrogative

word it is usually translatable by ‘else; with a cardinal number it is usually translatable by ‘more.’ Examples
are:

Sino pa ang paparito?
‘Who else is coming?’

Saan ka pa pumunta?
‘Where else did you go?’

May isa pa akong itatanong.
‘L have one more thing to ask.’

Dalawa pa ngang tasang kape.
‘Two more cups of coffee, please.’

Na has no comparable function.
(8) Na and pa are used in successive clauses (cf. §6.17, subsection (5)) to indicate incompatibility
between the actions, conditions, etc. expressed by the clauses. In some cases, the clause that includes pa

expresses a continuing condition that might have been expected to prevent, but does not prevent, the
action expressed by the clause that includes ma: e.g.,

Hilaw pa ang mangga, pinitas na ni Juan.
‘The mango was still unripe, but Juan picked it anyway.”

May sakit pa siya, pumasok na siya sa iskwela.
‘He was still sick, but he went to school anyway.”

In other cases, the clause that includes ma expresses a new condition, or a condition unspecified as to
newness or continuity, that might have been expected to prevent, but does not prevent, the action
expressed by the clause that includes pa: e.g.,

Dumarating na ang mga bisita, maglilinis ka pa ng bahay!
‘The guests are already arriving, and you're going to clean house!”

May sakit na siya, pumasok pa siya sa iskwela.
‘He was sick, but he went to school anyway.’

(The clauses may occur in either order. Thus, also:

Pinitas ni Juan ang mangga, hilaw pa.
‘Juan picked the mango, although it was still unripe.’

Maglilinis ka pa ng bahay, dumarating na ang mga bisita!
‘You're going to clean house, and the guests are already arriving!’)

(9), In negated constructions (cf. §§7.13 through 7.15), na and pa together with the negators,
express the following meanings:

(a) hindi na ‘not... any more/longer’
Hindi na ako pupunta roon.
‘I won't go there any more.’

Hindi ko na kailangan iyon.
‘I don’t need that any longer.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 419

(b) Aindi pa ‘not... yet.’
Hindi pa siya aalis.
‘He won't be leaving yet.’

Hindi pa siya umaalis.
‘He hasn't left yet."

(Note that the meaning ‘has not ... yet’ is expressed by hindi pa and a verb in the imperfective
aspect — cf. §2.7.)

(c) wala na ‘no more/longer, not . . . any more/longer’
Wala nang tubig sa pitsel.
‘There isn’t any more water in the pitcher.’

Wala na rito si Juan.
‘Juan is no longer here.”

(d) wala pa ‘no... yet, not (any)... yet
Wala pa siyang kaibigan dito.
‘He has no friends here yet.”

Wala pa rito si Juan.
‘Juan isn't here yet.’

(ce) huwag na ‘don’t... any more’
Huwag na ninyo siyang abalahin.
‘Don’t bother him any more.”

(*Huwag pa docs not occur; the meaning ‘don’t . . . yet’ is expressed by huwag muna: cf. §6.4,
subsection (h.3).)

§6.4. Class 2 and class 3 enclitic particles.

In the following presentation, the class 2 and class 3 particles are presented in the following
order: (a) man, (b) nga, (c) din/rin, (d) lamang/lang, (e) daw/raw, (f) ho and po, (g) ba, (h) muna, (i)
naman, (j) kasi. (The one class 2 particle man, is presented first; the class 3 particles are presented in the
order in which they preferably occur when in sequence with one another — cf. §6.2).

(a) Man
Man does not occur in basic sentences. Its most common uses are the following:

(1) with the negators hindi and wala (cf. §§7.13 and 7.14) and the class 3 enclitic
lamang/lang in sentences equivalent to English sentences with ‘not even’: ¢.g.,

Hindi ka man lamang nakapag-almusal.
‘You didn’t even get to eat breakfast.’

Wala man lang siya roon.
‘He wasn't even there.’

(2) _ in concessive clauses (cf. §6.17, subsection (4)) equivalent to English clauses with ‘even
if or ‘even though.’ (The concessive clause is optionally introduced by kahit. The main

420

(3)

(4)

CHAPTER 6

clause optionally but commonly includes the class 3 enclitic dinfrin — in this context
‘still, anyway.’) Examples are:

(Kahit) mahal man ang sapatos, binili ko rin.
‘Even though the shoes were expensive, I bought them anyway.”

Hindi ka rin maniniwala, (kahit) sabihin ko man ang totoo.
‘You still won’t believe it, even if I tell you the truth.’

in indefinite constructions (cf. §7.18), equivalent to English constructions with
‘whatever,’ ‘whoever,’ etc. (The construction is, once more, optionally introduced by
kahit.) Examples are:

(Kahit) ano man ang gusto mo, ibibili kita.
“Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.”

{ sa kahit sino
Sabihin mo ‘ pa mang dumating na umuwi na ako.
kanino

‘Tell whoever else comes that I’ve gone home.’

(Kahit) saan man ako pumunta, nakikita ko siya.
‘Wherever I go, I see him.”

with an inverted topic followed by ay or a pause (cf. §7.2), in which case the inverted
predicate obligatorily includes din/rin. The sentence expresses an unexpected similarity
between the referent of the topic and something or someone clse: c.g.,

{man ay

Ako natakot din.
man,

‘I too was scared (although I might not have been expected to be).”

{ man ay )
Ang kalabaw napapagod din.
man,

“(The) carabaos too get tired (although they might not have been expected to).’

When, as in the last example, the inverted topic that precedes man is an unmarked noun
oreceded hy ang, it may have either a definite or a generic meaning (e.g.. ‘the carabaos’ or
‘carabaos’). The ang is, however, optionally deletable in this construction, in which case
the topic always has a generic meaning. Thus:

{man ay)
Kalabaw napapagod din.
man, f

‘Carabaos too get tired.”

(While there is normally both a stylistic difference and a difference in meaning between a
sentence in which an inverted topic is followed by the inversion marker ay and one in
which it is followed by a pause — cf. §7.2, subsections (1) and (2) — only the stylistic
difference obtains in the case of the construction under discussion. That is, in the
man-din inversion construction, the only difference between a sentence in which the
inversion is marked by ay and an otherwise identical sentence in which it is marked by a

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 421

Pause is that the former represents the more formal style. This same generalization applies
to the man-din inverted—adverb construction presented under (5), immediately below.)

(5) with an inverted adverb followed by ay or a pause (cf. §7.2), in which case the following
construction obligatorily includes din/rin. In this construction man is usually translatable
by ‘even,’ din by ‘still’: eg.,

makapagsasa-
j maliit ay
Sa loob man ng bahay naming yaman din
maliit,
tayo.

‘Even inside our little house, we can still hold the dance.”

Kung gabi man, mainit din.
‘Even at night, it’s still hot.’

(6) in the first of two structures (words, phrases, etc.) joined by the coordinating conjunction
o ‘or’ (cf. §7.19, subsection (2)). A coordinate construction that includes man and o is
equivalent to an ‘either . . . or’ construction in English: e.g.,

ikaw man o ako ay maaaring gumawa niyon.
‘Either you or I can do that.’

Sa loob man o sa labas ay maaari tayong magsayawan.
“We can hold the dance either indoors or outdoors.’

(b) Nga
(J) The addition of nga to an imperative sentence (cf. §5.30) changes the imperative from a
command to a polite request: e¢.g.,

Kumain ka nga. ‘Please eat.’

(cf. Kumain ka.
‘Eat’)

(An imperative that includes ga may retain the imperative intonation pattern, /32/, or it
may receive an intonation used only for requests, /32t/ — cf. §1.24, pattern I.1 and
§1.27, pattern IV.3. The latter intonation pattern makes the request more polite.)

(2) Aga is also commonly used in hostative and optative constructions (cf. §5.30). In a
hortative construction, mga serves to clicit consent to the suggested course of action: ¢.g.,

Tingnan nga natin iyon.
‘How about our looking at that.’

(cf. Tingnan natin iyon.
‘Let’s look at that.")

In an optative construction (where some sort of enclitic particle is often obligatory) nga is
used in expressing a wish of moderate force: e.g.,

Linisin ko nga ang bahay.
“I guess I should clean the house.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
422

(3)

CHAPTER 6

In sentences other than imperatives and optatives, nga usually expresses affirmation or
confirmation. Examples are:

Oo nga.
“Yes, indeed.’

Ikaw nga ang matalino, e!
“On the contrary, it’s really you who are the intelligent one!”

Pagod nga ako.
‘I'm really tired.”

(c) Dinfrin

(d)

Q)

Q)

(3)

Some speakers use din and rin as free alternants in all phonemic contexts. Others prefer
din after consonants rin after vowels. Dinfrin is commonly used in the following ways:
to express similarity between two situations. In this use, din/rin is usually translatable by
‘too’ (in an affirmative sentence) or by ‘either’ (in a negative sentence). Examples are:

(Umaawit si Linda.) Umaawit din si Carmen.
‘(Linda is singing.) Carmen is singing too.’

Hindi marunong ng Kastila si Pedro. Hindi rin siya marunong ng salitang Pranses.
‘(Pedro doesn’t know Spanish.) He doesn’t know French either.’

to express the achievement of some more-or-less long—desired goal. In this use, din/rin
is usually translatable by ‘finally’ or ‘at last.’ Examples are:

Natapos din ang trabaho.
“We've finally finished the job.”

Salamat sa Diyos, nakita ko rin ang kuwintas kong nawawala.
‘Thank God, I've found my missing necklace at last.’

to express a moderate degree of the quality expressed by an adjective, or to partially
negate the adjective. In this use, din/rin is usually translatable by ‘fairly’ or ‘not very.’
Examples are:

(Kumusta?) Mabuti rin.

(‘How are you?’) ‘Fairly well.’

(Maganda ba si Maria?) Oo, maganda rin.

(‘Is Maria pretty?") “Yes, but not very (pretty).’”
(4) in association with man in various constructions — cf. (a.2), (a.4), and (a.5), above.
Lamang/tang

Lamang, or its shortened variant, Jang, commonly expresses a meaning of limitation (in
quantity, extent, importance, etc.) with respect to the construction of which it is an immediate
part. It is usually translatable by ‘only’ or ‘just.’ Examples are:

Tatlo lamang sila.
‘There are only three of them.’

Si Juan lang ang dumating.
‘The only one who came was Juan.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 423

Mangungulot lang ako.
‘I'm only a hairdresser.”

Kaninang umaga ko lamang natanggap ito.
‘It was just this morning that I received this.”

Maghintay ka sandali; magsusuot lang ako ng sapatos.
“Wait a moment; I'll just put on my shoes.”

(For examples of the use of lamang/lang with man after the negators hindi and wala, cf.
(a.1), above.)

Lamang or lang is obligatory after a verb in the recent—perfective aspect (cf.
§5.23): eg.,

Kakakain ko lamang.
‘I have just eaten.’

(e) Daw/raw
Some speakers use daw and raw as free alternants in all phonemic contexts. Others prefer
daw after consonants, raw after vowels. Daw/raw is used to mark indirect quotations (cf.
§3.28, subsection (2)), or in sentences that report or elicit the content of something said by
someone other than the speaker or the person(s) addressed. In some cases it may be translated
by ‘they say’ or ‘ say(s)/said’; in other cases it lacks a common English translation
equivalent. Examples are:

 

Sabi ng Nanay, manguha ka raw ng gulay.
‘Mother said that you should pick some vegetables.’

Saan daw pupunta si Juan?
‘Where did Juan say he was going?’
(or ‘Where did they say Juan was going?’)

Mabuti raw ang ani.
‘They say that the harvest is good.’

(f) Hoand po

Ho and po are used to express respect for the person or persons being addressed. The
social circumstances in which they are used are the same as those in which the second—person
plural pronouns kayo/ninyo/inyo and third—person—plural pronouns sila/nila/kanila replace the
second—person—singular pronouns. (In prayers addressed to God or the saints, however, po
(but not ho) is used with ikaw, etc.) Neither of these enclitics of respect occurs after the
familiar affirmative reply Oo ‘Yes.’ Instead of *Oo po or *0o ho, special polite
forms -- respectively, Opo and Oho — are used. Po is more formal and respectful than ho. Ho is
the more commonly used of the two especially among younger speakers, except in social
formulas (cf. §7.23), where po is the more common form. Examples are:

Magandang umaga po, Ginoong Cruz.
‘Good moming, Mr. Cruz.”

(cf. Magandang umaga, Carmen.
‘Good morning, Carmen.")

( ho )

Alam | ba ninyo kung anong oras ang alis ng bus?
po

*Do you know, (sir/madam), what time the bus leaves?’

(g) Ba

CHAPTER 6

Ba is the question marker (cf. §§7.3 through 7.12). Its use is optional except in the

confirmation—question formulas hindi ba, hindi ba’t, and dili nga ba't. It is more frequently
omitted in information questions (i.c., those with interrogative words like saan ‘where,’ sino
‘who.” ilan ‘how many,’) than in yes—no questions. Examples are:

Aalis ka na (ba)?
‘Are you leaving now?*

Saan ka (ba) nakatira?
‘Where do you live?’

Libro mo ito, hindi ba?
‘This is your book, isn’t it?”

(A variant form, baga, occurs in some regional dialects, but is not found in educated

Manila Tagalog.)
(h) = Muna.

qd)

(2)

(3)

Muna adds a meaning of temporariness, or anticipation of change, to the meaning
expressed by the rest of the sentence.

Where the nature of the anticipated change is not expressed, muna is often translatable by
‘for a while,’ ‘for the time being,’ ‘(for) a minute,” etc. Examples are:

Magpahinga muna tayo.
“Let's rest for a while (and then...)

Hagay mo muna doon.
“Put it there for the time being.”

Teka muna.
‘Wait a minute.’

Diyan muna kayo.
‘So long.”

(Literally: ‘You (stay) there for a while’: the social formula for temporary
leavetaking ~ cf. §7.23).

Where the nature of the anticipated change is expressed or clearly implied, muna is often
translatable by ‘first’: e.g.,

Bago siya nag-aral ng liksyon, nagbabasa muna siya ng diyaryo.
‘Before studying his lessons, he reads the newpapers (first).’

In negative imperatives and hortatives (cf. §5.30), muna is often translatable by

‘6, .

yet’: e.g.,

Huwag ka munang kumain.
‘Don’t eat yet.”

Huwag muna tayong umalis.
‘Let’s not leave yet.”

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 425

(i) Noman

Naman is commonly used in the following ways:

(1) to express dissimilarity between two situations. In this use, it is sometimes translatable by
‘on the other hand’ or ‘instead,’ although these expressions are Jess common in English
than naman is in Tagalog. Examples are:

Nag-aaral si Linda. Naglalaro naman si Carmen.
‘Linda is studying. Carmen ( -- on the

other hand — ) is playing.’
Bumili ako ng karne kahapon. Ngayon, isda naman.
‘I bought meat yesterday. Today, (it will be)

‘fish (instead).”

(2) to express a shift of viewpoint from one person, object, etc. to another, or a shift of role
from questioner to responder or vice versa. In these uses, nanian usually lacks a
translation equivalent in English. Examples are:

Juan ang pangalan ko. At ang iyo naman?
*My name is Juan. And yours?’
Kumusta ka? Mabuti. Ikaw naman?
“How are you?’ ‘Fine. And you?’

(3) in imperative sentences (cf. §5.30), to express politeness together with mild reproach.
Examples are:

Magpahinga ka naman. ‘Do rest.’

Huwag naman kayong maingay. ‘Please don’t be noisy.”

(Imperative sentences with naman do not get the intonation pattern for requests or that
for commands, but, rather, the emphatic statement pattern, /234/ — cf. §1.26, pattern
IIL.1.)

(4) after adjectives used as predicates, and after adjectives or adjective bases in exclamations
(cf. §4.24), to express a critical or negative attitude. Examples are:

Marumi
naman ito.
Mahal
{ dirty )
‘This is (and 1 am displeased.)’
| expensive \
{ Marumi
(cf. ito.
} Mahal
( dirty.” }
‘This is (statement of fact) )
| expensive.” {
Napakarumi

(j) = Kasi

CHAPTER 6

Kasi expresses cause. [t is used only in informal speech, being replaced in writing and in

formal speech by constructions with dahil or sapagka’t ‘because.’ Examples are:

Nagising ang bata. Maingay kasi kayo, e.

‘The baby was awakened. (That’s) because you were noisy.”

Nahuli si Juan sa klase. Tanghali na kasi siyang nagising, ¢.
‘Juan was late for class. (That’s) because he slept late.”

(Kasi is also used as a non-enclitic adverb, as in:

Nahuli si Juan sa klase. Kasi, tanghali na siyang nagising, e.
‘Juan was late for class. (That's) because he slept late.” )

§6.5. Class 4 enclitic particles.
The class 4 enclitic particles are presented below in the following order: (a) Kaya, (b), pala, (c) yata,
(d) tuloy, (e) sana.

(a) Kaya

q)

Kaya expresses or elicits speculation. It occurs in: (1) speculative imperatives, optatives,
and hortatives; and (2) speculative questions.
Kaya may occur in a basic or equational imperative, a basic of equational optative, ora
basic or equational hortative construction (cf. §5.30). The addition of kaya to such a
construction changes the meaning from that of expressing a command or a wish that an
action be performed to that of expressing speculation about the desirability of the action.
The English equivalents usually involve: ‘Perhaps. . . should.’ Examples are:

kayo
tayo
Maglakad kaya doon.
ako
si Juan
you
we
‘Perhaps should walk there.’
l
Juan
ninyo.
natin.
Ito kaya ang gamitin
ko.
ni Juan.
you
we
‘Perhaps should use this.’
I
Juan

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 427

(Note that, while the actor in an optative construction without kaya (or sana — cf.e.1),
below) is always expressed by a personal pronoun, the actor in a speculative optative with
kaya may be expressed by a nominal of some other type as well. Thus while there is no
*Maglakad si Juan doon, the sentence Maglakad kaya si Juan doon is perfectly
acceptable.)

(2) Kaya occurs in ycs—no questions (cf. §7.4), alternative questions (§7.5), and
information questions (§§7.7 ff.). When kaya is used in a question, the
question—marking enclitic ba (cf. §6.4, subsection (e)) is usually omitted. In questions,
kaya elicits the speculative opinion of the person(s) addressed, and is often translatable
by ‘do you suppose.” Examples are:

Mabuti kaya ang ani?
“Do you suppose the harvest will be good?”

Naglakad kaya sila, o sumakay?
‘Do you suppose they walked, or rode?”

Sino kaya ang mananalo?
‘Who do you suppose will win?’

(Speculative imperatives, optatives, and hortatives may be changed to speculative
questions by the use of an interrogative intonation pattern (/2t/, /31t/, or
1314] — respectively, pattern 1.2, §1.24, pattern II1.3, §1.26, and pattern IV.4,

§1.27): eg.,
ninyo?
natin?
Ito kaya ang gamitin
ko?
ni Juan?
you
we
“Do you suppose should use this?’)
I
Juan

(b) Pala
Pala is used in expressing mild surprise at new information, or an unexpected event or
situation, as in the first and second examples below, or in expressing an afterthought, as in the
third and fourth examples.

Ikaw pala ang kapatid ni Pedro.
‘So you’re Pedro’s sister.”

Maganda pala ito, a!
‘Oh, but this is pretty!”

Ano pala ang bibilhin ko para si iyo?
“By the way, what shall ] buy for you?’

Kunin mo pala ang martilyo.
‘(And ... oh, yes,) get the hammer.’

CHAPTER 6

{c) Yata
Yara is used in statements (not in questions or imperatives) to express uncertainty
or Jack of conviction. Examples are:

Mahal yata iyon.
‘That seems expensive.’

Hindi yata tama iyon.
‘That doesn’t seem right.’

Nagugutom yata ang bata.
‘The child seems to be hungry.’

(d)  Tuloy
Tuloy is used:
(1) to characterize one action or situation as resulting from another. In this use, it is

usually translatable by ‘as a result.’ Examples are:

Maingay kayo. Nagising tuloy ang bata.

“You were noisy. As a result, the baby was awakened.’
Naiwanan ako ng bus. Nahuli tuloy ako sa klase.

‘I missed my bus. As a result, | was late for class."

(2) to characterize an action as being logically or conveniently performed together
with another action. In this use, tufoy is often preceded by the enclitic particle na (cf.
§6.3), and is translatable by such expressions as ‘might as well...at the same time,”
‘while (I’m, etc.) at it, (I, etc.) might as well, etc. Examples are:

Magwalis ka sa bakuran. Magdilig ka (na) tuloy ng halaman,
‘Sweep the yard. You might as well water the plants at the same time.’

Tutungo ako sa kabayanan. Daraan (na) tuloy ako sa opisina.
‘I'm going downtown. While I’m at it, | might as well drop in at the office.’

(e) Sana
Sana is commonly used in the following ways:
(1) toexpress a hope: e.g.,

Masasaya sana sila.
‘L hope they’re happy.”

Nanalo sana ang kandidato ko.
‘I hope my candidate won.”

Manalo sana ang kandidato ko.
‘lL hope my candidate wins.”

(In this use, sana docs not occur with verbs in the contemplated aspect. When, as in the
last example, the hope relates to an event that has not yet occurred, an optative
construction — involving the basic form of the verb — is used (cf. §5.30). Note that in an
optative construction with sana (or kaya — cf. (a.1), above), the actor need not be
expressed by a personal pronoun.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 429

(2) with a verb in the contemplated aspect, to express an unrealized intention: e.g.,

Pupunta sana ako sa pulong kahapon pero nagbago ang isip ko.
‘Lhad intended to go to the meeting yesterday, but | changed my mind.”

Bibilhin sana nila ang bahay, pero kulang ang pera nila.
‘They would have bought the house, but they didn’t have enough money.”

(3) in the main clause of a sentence that includes a conditional clause (cf. §6.15),
in which case the main clause expresses a situation that has not occurred, as a result of
the condition’s being unfulfilled: ¢.g.,

Kung pumunta siya sa pulong, nakausap sana niya ang Alkalde.
‘If he had gone to the meeting, he could have gotten (o talk to the Mayor.’

(cf. Kung pumunta siya sa pulong, nakausap niya ang Alkalde.
‘If he went to the meeting, he got to talk to the Mayor.’)

*l would be at the University now, if | had not

§6.6. Positions of enclitic particles in sentences.

The position of any given enclitic particle in relation to other enclitics (particles or pronouns) within
a single enclitic sequence is presented in §6.2. The present section deals with the position of enclitic
particles in relation to non-enclitic sentence elements.

As was noted in §6.2, enclitic particles, with certain statable exceptions, follow the first word of the
structures of which they constitute an immediate part. From the point of view of the types of structures of
which they may constitute an immediate part, the enclitic particles may be divided into four groups, as
follows:

Group A: ba, kasi, kaya, man.

Group B: daw/raw, din/rin, ho, naman, nga, pala, po, sana, tuloy, yata.

Group C: lamangy/lang, muna.

Group D: na, pa.

Enclitic particles belonging to group A always constitute an immediate part of the initial component
of a sentence or a clause, whether this initial component is a predicate, a topic, or an adverbial. (A clause is
a part of a sentence that itself has the internal structure of a sentence.) Note, for example, the position of
ba, a group A particle, in the following sentences:

sasayaw ba sila ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi?
(Kung pakikiusapan ko sila,) sila bay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi?

bukas ba ng gabi ’ysasayaw sila ng pandanggo?
‘(If Lask them to,) will they dance a fandango tomorrow night?’

In each case, ba is an immediate part of the sentence — initial or clause — initial component, and follows its
first word. In one case, ba follows the first word of the predicate (sasayaw), in another, the inverted topic
(sila), in another, the first word of an inverted adverb (bukas). (For a discussion of inversion constructions,
cf. §7.2.) Regardless of the function of the initial component within the sentence or clause, a group A

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
430 CHAPTER 6

particle obligatorily constitutes an immediate part of it, and normally follows its first word. (More
precisely, the particle follows the first word other than a non-pre-enclitic — cf. below and §3.29. Thus,
within the initial adverb bukas ng gabi ‘tomorrow night,’ bukas may, in most cases, optionally be treated as
a non-pre-nclitic, in which case, since ng is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic, gabi serves as the pre-enclitic
word. Thus, also:

Bukas ng gabi ba’y sasayaw sila ng pandanggo?)

Group B particles may occur in all the same sentence positions as group A particles, but may also
occur in a variety of other sentence positions. That is, group B particles may always constitute an
immediate part of the sentence—initial component, but need not do so in all cases. In a basic sentence, a
group B particle, like a group A particle, must normally constitute an immediate part of the predicate. Thus
the group B particle dinfrin must follow sasayaw in the following sentence:

Sasayaw din sila ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(The Tagalog sentence involves the same ambiguities as its English equivalent, and may mean: ‘They (as
well as someone else) will dance ...° ‘They will dance (as well as do something else) . . . * ‘They will dance
a fandango (as well as something else)...” or ‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night (as well as at
some other time).”) When, however, a group B particle occurs in one of certain types of derived sentences
(or clauses with the internal structure of derived sentences of these types), it may constitute an immediate
part of some non-sentence—initial (or non-clause—initial) component. The types of non-sentence—initial
components of which group B particles most frequently constitute an immediate part are: inverted
predicates after ay or pause (cf. §7.2) and nominalized verbals.

Examples of sentences in which a group B enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part of an
inverted predicate are:

Sila’y sasayaw din ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(cf. Sila rin ay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night.’)

Bukas ng gabi’y sasayaw din sila ng pandanggo.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(cf. Bukas din ng gabi’y
sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
Bukas ng gabi rin ay
‘Tomorrow night too they will dance a fandango.’)

(As may be observed by comparing the translations of the sentences in which dinjrin constitutes an
immediate part of the inverted predicate with those in which it constitutes an immediate part of the
sentence—initial component, the relative flexibility of group B particles in sentences involving inversion
may be used to resolve, or partly resolve, ambiguities that are unavoidable in basic sentences.)

An example of a sentence in which a group B enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part of a

nominalized verbal is:

Sila ang sasayaw din ng pandanggo.
‘They are the ones who will dance a fandango too.’

(cf. Sila rin ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
‘They are also the ones who will dance a fandango.’)

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 431

(Group B particles may also constitute an immediate part of non-initial sentence—components of certain
other types: e.g., some kinds of adverbial phrases, as in:

Ito ang binili ko para rin sa iyo.
‘This is the one J bought for you too.")

The group C particles, Jamangflang and muna, are similar to the group B particles in the range of
structures of which they may constitute an immediate part. The major difference between the two classes is
that the group C particles cannot normally constitute an immediate part of a sentence—initial (or
clause—initial) adverbial followed by ay or pause. Thus, there is no:

lamang
*Bukas ng gabi ay sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
muna
but only:
{ Jamang
Bukas ng gabi ay sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
l muna

just )
‘They will | dance a fandango tomorrow night.’
| first {

Group C particles may, however, constitute an immediate part of an inverted topic before ay or pause, or of
an inverted predicate after ay or pause. Thus:

lamang
Sila ay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
muna

or:

{ lamang
Sila’y sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.

{mn

just
‘They will | dance a fandango tomorrow night.”
first

And they may constitute an immediate part of a non-initial nominalized verbal, etc.:

lamang
Sila ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
muna

j just

‘They’re the ones who will
l first

dance a fandango.’

The group D particles na and pa are also similar to group B particles in the range of structures of
which they may constitute an immediate part. But group D particles cannot normally constitute an

432 CHAPTER 6

immediate part of cither a topic or an adverbial followed by ay or pause. Thus there are no such sentences
as:

na’y
*Sila { sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
3)
na
*Bukas { ng gabi’y sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.

Like group B and group C particles (and unlike group A particles), na and pa may, however, constitute an
immediate part of a non-initial nominalized verbal, etc.:

na
Sila ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
pa
now dance
‘They’re the ones who will a fandango.”

go on dancing

(Na and pa show certain peculiarities with respect to the treatment of some sentence—initial or
clause—initial words as non-pre-enclitics. Specifically, certain words that are optionally non-pre-enclitic
with respect to the other enclitic particles —e.g., bakit ‘why,’ dahil ‘because’ halos ‘almost — are
obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to na and pa. Thus either:

ba
Bakit din hindi nagpahinga ang bata?
muna

There is no:

*Bakit hindi nagpapahinga ang bata?)
(m

As was stated in §3.29, enclitics do not always follow the first word of a construction of which they
constitute an immediate part. The word that the enclitics follow (the PRE-ENCLITIC WORD hereafter, P)
is in some cases preceded by one or more NON-PRE-ENCLITICS (hereafter, N). Certain sentence elements
never function as P, and may be called OBLIGATORY NON-PRE-ENCLITICS; other function cither as N
or as P, and may be called OPTIONAL NON-PRE-ENCLITICS.

An inventory of sentence elements that function as N (either obligatorily or optionally) with respect
to enclitic pronouns is presented in §3.29. In general, these same elements function as N with respect to
enclitic particles. There are, however, certain differences in the lists of elements that serve as N with respect
to the two types of enclitic words. These differences are of the following kinds:

(1) Certain elements that are obligatorily N with respect to enclitic pronouns are never N with
respect to enclitic particles: viz., adverbs of which the enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part, and
which are followed by pause or by the inversion marker ay. Thus:

Bukas ba’y aalis siya?
‘Will he leave tomorrow?’

Bukas ba, aalis siya?
‘Is it tomorrow that he’s leaving?’
(cf. §3.29, inventory, subsection I.C.)

(2) Certain elements that are obligatorily N with respect to enclitic pronouns are optionally N with

respect to enclitic particles. These elements include:
(a) The adverb halos ‘almost’ (cf. §3.29, inventory, subsection 1.4.7). Thus:

{ nagkasakit daw
Halos siya.
| daw nagkasakit

‘They say he almost got sick.’

(b) The subordinating conjunctions bukod ‘besides,’ (imag )buhat ‘since,’ dahil ‘because,’ dangan ‘were

434 CHAPTER 6

it not that,’ maliban ‘unless,’ (mag }nula ‘since,’ noon ‘when,’ sa sandali ‘the moment that’ and (kung) sakali
‘in case,’ (subsection 1.A.10). Some examples are;

( may sakit po
Dahil siya, hindi siya makakarating.
l po may sakit

“Because he’s sick, sir, he won’t be able to come.’

sandali bang umalis )
Sa siya, sasabihan kita?
sandaling umalis ba

‘The moment that he leaves, shall I tell you?’

sakali bang makita mo

(Kung) siya, iimbitahin mo siya?
sakaling makita mo

‘In case you see him, will you invite him?’

(c) Non-final components of coordinate phrases (subsection 1.B.5). Thus:

Mabuti, malakas, at masaya daw
Mabuti, malakas daw, at masaya siya.
Mabuti daw, malakas, at masaya j

‘They say he’s well, strong, and happy.’

(d) Non-final components of adverbial phrases and directional complements that are not followed by
the linker na/-ng (subsection I.B.6). Thus:

ng gabi ba
Bukas siya aalis?
ba ng gabi
‘Is it tomorrow night that he’s leaving?
bahay sa probinsya ba
Sa siya pupunta?
bahay ba sa probinsya

‘Is it the house in the provinces that he’s going to?’

(3) Certain construction—initial elements are obligatorily N with enclitic particles, but do not occur
as initial elements of constructions of which enclitic pronouns constitute an immediate part: viz., non-final
components of addresses (cf. §4.4, subsection (1)), dates that involve English numbers (cf. §4.4,
subsection (2)), and expressions of percentage (cf. §4.4, subsection (4.c)): e.g.,

Dos
daang Medel po iyon.

‘That's 2 Medel Street, sir.’

July third ba ngayon?
“Is today July third?’

Anim na
porsyento daw ang buwis.
Seis

‘They say the tax is six per cent.’

(Cf. (4.a), below, for the treatment of dates that involve Spanish or Tagalog numbers.)

(4) Certain construction—initial elements are optionally N with enclitic particles, but do not occur as
initial elements of constructions of which enclitic pronouns constitute an immediate part. These elements
include:

(a) Non-final componnents of dates that involve Spanish or Tagalog numbers (cf. §4.4, subsection

(2)).

ng Hulyo ba
A-tres
ba ng Hulyo
ngayon?
{ ng Hulyo ba
Ikatlo
ba ng Hulyo
‘Is today July third?’

(b) The reservational—phrase, partisanship—phrase, and purpose—phrase marker para (cf. §4.20,
subsections (1), (2), and (3)): e.g.,

sa iyo ba
Pasa ito?
ba sa iyo
“Is this for you?’
kay Makapagal ba
Para si Ernesto?
ba kay Makapagal
‘Is Emesto for Makapagal?’
{ sa pagluluto ba
Para iyan?
| ba sa pagluluto
‘Is that for cooking?’

(c) The referential—phrase maskers tungkol, hinggil, and nauukol (§4.20, subsection (5)): e.g.,

Tungkol
{ sa giyera ba

Hinggil ang kuwento?
| ba sa giyera

Nauukol

‘Is the story about war?’

With the above exceptions, the inventory of non-pre-enclitic elements presented in §3.29 generally applies
to enclitic particles as well as to enclitic pronouns.

436 CHAPTER 6

§6.7. Movable adverbs: introduction.

A moveable adverb is an adverb that, in general, has no fixed word—order relation to other sentence
elements. In a basic sentence a movable adverb may occur between components of the predicate, after the
predicate, or after the topic. The meaning of the sentence is not affected by changing the position of the

movable adverb. Thus the following four sentences, which differ from one another in the placement of the
movable adverb kahapon ‘yesterday,’ are identical in meaning:

Sumulat kahapon ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kahapon kay Maria si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kay Maria kahapon si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan kahapon.
‘Juan wrote a letter to Maria yesterday.”

Movable adverbs may also occur at the beginning of a sentence or clause in the various inversion
constructions described in §7.2. The placement of a movable adverb at the beginning of a sentence or
clause usually results in a sentence that differs in meaning or in stylistic level from the same sentence with a
non-initial adverb. Thus:

Kahapon ay sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
‘Juan wrote a letter to Maria yesterday.’ (formal style)

Kahapon, sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
“Yesterday, Juan wrote a letter to Maria.”
(Possible implication: ‘Today, he will do something else.”)

Kahapon sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
‘It was yesterday that Juan wrote a letter to Maria.”

There is, however, one type of inversion construction — non-emphatic adverb inversion — in which the
initial placement of the adverb involves no change of meaning. (Only certain types of adverb — e.g., manner

adverbs (cf. §6.10) — occur in this inversion construction.) In non-emphatic adverb inversion, the adverb is
linked to the rest of the sentence by the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11). An example is:

Mabilis na naglakad si Pedro.
“Pedro walked quickly.’

(cf. Naglakad si Pedro nang mabilis.
‘Pedro walked quickly.’)

When an adverb occurs in initia) position, there are, in certain specifiable cases, obligatory changes in
the shape of the adverb itself. Specifically, if the adverb in non-initial position would be introduced by the
marker nang or the linker na/-ng this introductory element is deleted before the initial adverb. (The marker
spelled nang is phonemically identical with the marker spelled ng: both spellings represent /nan/. The
spelling nang is conventionally used for the marker at the beginning of a time adverb (cf. §6.8), a manner

adverb (§6.10), a measurement adverb (§6.11, subsection (3)), or a time clause (§ 6.16). the spelling ng is
conventionally used in most other cases.) Thus the nang that introduces the time adverb in:

Aalis tayo nang ala-una.
“We'll leave at one o'clock.’

is absent in:

Ala-una, aalis tayo.
“At one o’clock, we'll leave.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 437

Similarly, the linker that introduces the manner adverb in:

Umalis na bigla ang bisita.
‘The guest left suddenly.’

is absent in:

Biglang umalis ang bisita.
‘The guest suddenly left.’

(The deletion of introductory nang or na/-ng also applies to cases in which the adverb immediately follows
the inversion marker ay. Thus:

Tayo ay ala-una aalis.
‘It’s at one o’clock that we'll leave.’ (formal style)

Ang bisita ay biglang umalis.
‘The visitor suddenly left.’ (formal style)

Such constructions are themselves inversions of inversions: i.e., ay inversions of sentences that themselves
involve adverb inversion. Thus Tayo ay ala-una aalis is an ay inversion of:

Ala-una tayo aalis.
‘It’s at one o’clock that we'll leave.’

and Ang bisita ay biglang umalis is an ay inversion of:

Biglang umalis ang bisita.
‘The guest suddenly left.’ (formal style))

The various classes of movable adverbs are presented in subsequent sections as follows: TIME

ADVERBS in §6.8; LOCATIVE ADVERBS in §6.9; MANNER ADVERBS in §6.10; other movable
adverbs in §6.11.

§6.8. Time adverbs.

Adverbs expressing time may be divided into the following classes: (1) MARKED TIME ADVERBS;
(2) UNMARKED TIME ADVERBS; (3) TIME GERUND CONSTRUCTIONS. These classes are presented
below in the listed order. Then there is a discussion of: (4) EXPANSIONS OF TIME ADVERBS; and (5)
TIME ADVERBS AS PSEUDO-PREDICATES.

(1) MARKED TIME ADVERBS. A marked time adverb is introduced by one of the following
markers — (a) nang, (b) sa, (c) noon plus the linker na/-ng, (d) Aung, (ka)pag, tuwi + naj-ng, (e) buhat,
mula, umpisa, (f) hanggang — or by (g) the linker na/-ng.

(a) Nang introduces time adverbs of two types: POINT-TIME ADVERBS (adverbs that refer to a
single point in time or to a single delimited period of time) and FREQUENCY ADVERBS (see below).
Point—time adverbs introduced by nang are tenscless: that is, they may be used to refer to a point or
period of time that is past, present, or future: e.g.,

magtatrabaho
Bakit siya nagtatrabaho nang Linggo?
nagtrabaho

{ is he going to work
is he working on (a) Sunday?”
did he work

‘Why

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
438 CHAPTER 6

In this respect, point—time adverbs introduced by nang differ from certain point—time adverbs discussed
under (b) and (c) below.

The nang of a point-Time adverb may be followed by any of various words and phrases that express
points in time or periods of time: e.g., an expression of clock time (cf. §4.4, subsection (6)); makalampas
ng or pasado plus an expression of clock time; a date (cf. §4.4, subsection (2)); the name of a part of the
day (e.g., umaga ‘morning,’ hapon ‘afternoon,’ gabi ‘night’); the name of a day of the week; the name of a
month, etc. (The names of the days of the week are, in order from Monday through Sunday: Lunes,
Martes, Miyerkoles, Huwebes, Biyernes, Sabado, Linggo. The names of the months are, in order from
January through December: Enero, Pebrero, Maso, Abril, Mayo, Hunyo, Hulyo, Agosto, Setyembre,

Oktubre, Nobyembre, Disyembre; Eng)ish names for months are also occasionally used.)
Phrases consisting of mang plus an expression of clock time are translated by English ‘at’ phrases;

those consisting of nang plus a date are translated by English ‘on’ phrases: e.g.,

nang ala-una ‘at one o’clock’
Nang a-primero ng Encro ‘on the first of January’

Phrases consisting of nang makalampas ng or nang pasado plus an expression of clock time are
translated by English phrases introduced by ‘after,’ thus:

| { makalampas ng |
nang ala-una ‘after one o'clock’ |
. | pasado

Phrases in which nang is followed by the name of a part of the day involve a meaning of |

indefiniteness. The phrase nang umaga, for example, is closer in meaning to English ‘some moming’ or ‘of a

morning’ than it is to ‘in the morning.’ (The latter meaning is expressed by a saphrase — see (b), below.)

Phrases in which nang is followed by the name of a day of the week or of a month also involve a

| meaning of indefiniteness. Nang Lunes may, for example, be equivalent to English ‘on a Monday’ (or to ‘on

: Monday’ when this is used with an indefinite meaning), while nang Enero may be equivalent to English ‘one
| January’ (or to ‘in January’ when this is used with an indefinite meaning).

There is a group of nang point-time phrases in which nang is followed by buong (buo ‘whole’ plus the
linker na/-ng) plus a word that designates a period of time. These phrases are equivalent to English time |

phrases that begin with ‘all’: e.g., nang buong umaga ‘all morning,’ nang buong maghapon ‘all day (from
sunrise to sunset),’ nang buong magdamag ‘all night (from sunset to sunrise),’ nang buong linggo ‘all week,’
nang buong taon ‘all year.’ (In the case of the phrases ending in maghapon and magdamag, buong is
redundant, since nang maghapon and nang magdamag themselves mean ‘all day’ and ‘all night’ respectively.)
Nang is optionally deletable before buong in a time phrase. Thus:

j nang buong umaga.
Natulog sila

‘They slept all morning.”

| (In the case of phrases ending in maghapon and magdamag, nang is optionally deletable whether or not the
phrase also includes buong. Thus:

buong umaga. |
nang (buong) magdamag.
Natulog sila
(buong) magdamag. !

‘They slept all night.’)

Nang frequency adverbs consist of nang plus one of the following: madalas ‘often’; minsan-minsan
‘sometimes’; paminsan-minsan ‘occasionally’; a cardinal number plus the linker na/-ng plus beses or ulit

 
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 439

(both of which mean “times’); a frequentative number (cf 845. subsection (d} plus, optionally, ihe linker
naj-ng plus beses or ulit. Examples are:

madalas.

minsan-minsan.
Dumalaw siya sa kanila nang paminsan-minsan.

dalawang beses/ulit.

makaapat (na beses/ulit).

often.’

sometimes.”
He visited them occasionally.’

twice.’

four times.’

(Madalas, minsan-minsan and paminsan-minsan may be preceded by the linker na/-ng—see (g),
below — instead of nang, without change of meaning. Frequency adverbs formed with cardinal numbers and
those formed with frequentative numbers are identical in meaning. Thus ‘twice’ may be either nang
dalawang beses/ulit or nang makalawa(ng beses/ulit) and ‘four times’ may be either nang apat na beses/ulit
or nang makaapat (na beses/ulit).)

As is noted in §6.7, nang never introduces an adverb in sentence~ initial or clause—initial position (or
after the inversion marker ay). Most nang point—time adverbs may occur initially in any of three types of
inversion constructions (cf. §7.2): ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic adverb inversion. Each
of these constructions involves deletion of nang. Compare:

Nagsimba si Maria nang alas otso.
‘Maria went to church at eight o'clock.’

and:

Alas otso’y nagsimba si Maria. )
Alas otso, nagsimba si Maria.
Alas otso nagsimba si Maria. j

‘Maria went to church at eight o'clock.’ (formal style) }
‘At eight o’clock, Maria went to church.”
“It was at eight o’clock that Maria went to church.’ j

Those nang point—time adverbs that include buong and/or one of the two words maghapon and magdamag,
as well as all nang frequency adverbs, may occur initially in any of four types of inversion
constructions: the three mentioned above, plus the non-emphatic adverb inversion construction. In the

latter construction, the Joss of initial nang is accompanied by the addition of the linker na/-ng after the
adverb: e.g,

Buong umagang
(Buong) maghapong
nilinis ng Nanay ang bahay.
Makalawang
Apat na beses na

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
440 CHAPTER 6

all morning.”
all day.”
‘Mother cleaned the house
twice.
four times.”
(cf. Nilinis ng Nanay ang bahay nang buong umagi, etc.)

(b) Sa introduces two types of point—time adverbs: TENSELESS POINT-TIME ADVERBS, and
FUTURE POINT-TIME ADVERBS. In the tenseless adverbs, sa is followed by the name of a part of the
day, by certain formations involving the prefix k(inja- together with the suffix -an, or by one of certain
constructions involving nouns that designate periods of time: ¢.g., araw ‘day,’ linggo ‘week,’ buwan
‘month.’ A phrase consisting of sa plus the name of a part of the day involves a meaning of definiteness. In
this respect it differs from a phrase consisting of nang plus the name of a part of the day. Compare the
translations of the following sentences:

Dumating kami roon sa umaga.
‘We arrived there in the morning.”

Dumating kami roon nang umaga.
‘We arrived there of a morning.’

The k(inja-... -an formations that occur in tenseless sa phrases have as bases the name of a past of
the day, the name of a day of the week, or bukas ‘tomorrow.’ (Some speakers use only the full form of the
prefix, kina-; others use either Kina- or ka-. The final vowel of the prefix shows optional length.
Thus: /kina(‘)/, /ka(-)/. If the independent form of the base has an inherently long penultimate vowel, the
vowel Iength is normally shifted to the following syllable in the kfinja-...-an formations.
Thus: kfinJabukasan /k(in)a(:)ouka‘san/ — cf. bukas /bukas/. Additionally, there is a replacement of /e/
by /i/ and /of by /u/ in the syllable receiving the vowel length; thus: k/injalunisan {k(in)a(-)luni-sanf (cf.
Lunes flu:nes/), kinahapunan {k(in)a(-)hapu‘nan/ (cf. hapon /ha‘pon/). The base Biyernes /bye'mes/,
however, does not undergo length shift’ in the Afinja-...-an formation, thus k/injabyernesan
/k(in)a(-)bye"rnesan/ (cf. Byernes /bye-rnes/). Bases without inherently long vowels and those with
inherently long vowels in syllables preceding the penultimate syllable undergo no change in the
kfinja-...-an formations. Thus: k(in jagabihan /{k(in)a(:)gabihan/ (cf. gabi /gabih/): k(in Jamiyerkolesan
/k(in)a(‘)miye’rkolesan/ (cf. Miyerkoles /miye*rkoles/).) A phrase consisting of sa plus a Kfontja-... -an
formation is equivalent to an English phrase introduced by ‘(on) the following’: ¢.g., sa kinagabihan ‘(on)
the following night,” sa kinabukasan ‘(on) the following day.” (The same meaning may be expressed by a
kfin}a-. . . -an formation without a preceding sa: cf. subsection (2), below.)

Some examples of tenseless sa phrases involving terms for periods of time are: sa araw ng piyesta ‘on
the day of the fiesta,’ sa ikalawang linggo ‘in the second week,’ sa buwan ng Enero ‘in the month of
January,’ sa loob ng ilang taon ‘within a few years,’ sa fag-ulan ‘in the rainy season.” (Note that while ‘in the
month of January’ is expressed by a sa phrase, ‘in January’ with a tenseless meaning must be expressed by a
nang phrase — see (a), above. As is explained immediately below, a phrase consisting of sa plus the name of
a month has a future meaning.)

In the future point—time adverbs, sa may be followed by any of the following: a date, the name of a
day of the week, the name of a month, makalawa ‘the second day from today,’ or a modification

construction consisting of (1) the cardinal number ésa ‘one,’ the linker na/-ng, and a noun that designates a
period of time or (2) one of the two contemplated—aspect verb forms susunod ‘will follow’ and darating

‘will come,’ the linker na/-ng, and a noun that designates a period of time. In the case of the constructions
with susunod and darating, the marker sa may be followed by mga to give a plural meaning to the
noun — see the last example in the list below. Future point—time adverbs introduced by sa are often

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS “1

translatable by English phrases with ‘next,’ or by phrases with ‘on’ or ‘in’ where the latter have a future
meaning. Some examples are:

( ‘next January first”
sa a-primero ng Enero

l ‘on the first of (next) January’

{ ‘next Monday’

sa Lunes
| “on Monday (next)’
‘next January’
sa Enero
‘in January (of next year)’
sa makalawa ‘the day after tomorrow’

( ‘next week’
sa isang linggo

| ‘in one week (from now)’

susunod ‘next month’
sa (mga) { na buwan ‘in the month(s)
| following this one”
darating

‘in the coming
month(s)’

(To express the equivalent of ‘in one week,” ‘in four years,’ etc., with a tenseless meaning, Tagalog uses a
phrase introduced by sa loob ng, literally ‘within.’ Thus:

j isang linggo.
Tinapos niya ang trabaho sa loob ng

| apat na taon.

one week.’
‘He finished the job (with)in
four years.’

There is no:

isang linggo.
*Tinapos niya ang trabaho sa
apat na taon.

(c) Noong (which is analyzable as the ng form of the deictic pronoun ivon (cf. §3.4) plus the linker
-ng) introduces PAST POINT-TIME ADVERBS; it may be followed by most of the words and phrases that
occur after sa in future point—time phrases (see (b), above), except that in modification constructions
involving verbs, the perfective—aspect verb nakaraan ‘passed,’ rather than susunod or darating occurs.
Noong phrases are often translatable by English phrases with ‘last’ or ‘ago,’ or by phrases with ‘on," ‘in,’ or
‘during’ where the latter have a past meaning. Some examples are:

‘last January first’
noong a-primero ng Enero
‘on the first of (last) January’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
442 CHAPTER 6

‘last Monday’

noong Lunes
‘on Monday (last)’

f ‘last January’

‘last week’

noong isang linggo
‘one week ago”
{ ‘a year ago”
noong nakaraang taon
lin the year that (just) passed’
noong (mga) nakaraang linggo ‘during the past week(s)’

Noong may also be followed by panahon ‘time’ plus a ng phrase, to express the equivalent of English
phrases with ‘during’ or ‘at the time of,’ where these have past reference: e.g.,

Nagtatrabaho ako sa Maynila noong panahon ng World War II.
during }
“Il was working in Manila World War II.

at the time of {

(d) Kung, (ka}pag, and tuwing are all used to introduce RECURRENT-TIME ADVERBS (adverbs
that express a number of points in time or periods of time treated as recurrences of the same point or
period in systems of time measurement). They may be followed by various words and phrases that express
points of time or periods of time: expressions of clock time, dates, names of parts of the day, etc., Kung
and (ka /pag (kapag alternates freely with pag) are identical in meaning in time adverbs. (Both words are also
used to introduce time clauses — cf. §6.15; in this use, the words have overlapping, rather than identical,
meanings.) Kung is, however, the more commonly used time-phrase marker in educated Manila Tagalog. In
recurrent time adverbs kung and (kaj/pag mean literally ‘when.’ Their common English equivalents
sometimes involve pluralization — e.g., kKung/(ka}pag umaga ‘mornings (i.e., when it’s morning),’ Aung
Linggo ‘(on) Sundays {i.e., when it’s Sunday)’ — but are sometimes indistinguishable from point—time
adverbs. Thus ‘in August’ in the sense of ‘when it’s August’ is translatable by kung/(kaJpag Agosto, but in
other senses has different English equivalents (see (a), (b), and (c), above). Kung (but never (ka)pag) also
occurs in the frequency adverb kung minsan ‘sometimes.’

Tuwing phrases are equivalent to English time phrases with ‘every’: e.g., fuwing umaga ‘every
morning,’ tuwing Linggo ‘every Sunday,’ tuwing Agosto ‘every August.’ The noun faon ‘year’ never occurs
after tuwing, and the nouns oras ‘hour’ and buwan ‘month’ occur after tuwing only when they are followed
by ng phrases of specification (cf. §3.28), thus: wing oras ng panaghalian ‘every dinner time’, but never
simply *tuwing oras; and tuwing buwan ng Agosto ‘every August’ (literally, ‘every month of August’), but
never simply *tuwing buwan. The English phrases ‘every year,’ ‘every hour’, and ‘every month’ therefore
lack Tagalog equivalents in the form of phrases marked by tuwing. (For the equivalents of these phrases, see
(2) below.) (There are two synonymous time adverbs used primarily in literature — fewina and sa
tuwi-tuwina ‘always’ — that may be regarded as irregular sewing phrases.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 443

(e) Buhat, mula (or its less common variant simula), and umpisa are more or less synonymous as
markers of time adverbs; they are equivalent to English ‘since’ or ‘from... on.’ Buhat/mulafumpisa may
precede any of the following: expressions of clock time (optionally preceded by nang or sa — sce below);
future point—time phrases introdued by sa (cf. (b), above); past point—time phrases introduced by noong
(cf. (c), above); the various point-time words and phrases dealt with under (2) and (4), below (¢.g., Kahapon
“yesterday,” mamayang hapon “this (coming) afternoon’).

The nang that obligatorily precedes an expression of clock time in a tenseless point—time adverb (cf.
(a), above) is optional after buhat, mula or umpisa. Thus:

Mag-aaral
Nag-aaral sila buhat/mula/umpisa (nang) alas otso.
Nag-aral
will study
‘They study from eight o’clock on.’
studied

For some speakers, buhat sa, mula sa and umpisa sa alternate freely with buhat nang, etc., before a
clock—time expression where the reference is to recurrent periods of time or to a time in the future. Thus,
also, for these speakers:

Mag-aaral

sila buhat/mula/umpisa sa alas otso.
Nap-aaral

Other examples of time adverbs introduced by buhat, mula, or umpisa ate: buhat noong isang buwan
‘since last month,’ mula sa Enero ‘from (next) January on,’ umpisa nang 1950 ‘since 1950,’ buhat kahapon
‘since yesterday,” mula mamayang hapon ‘from this (coming) afternoon on."

(f) Hanggang is equivalent to English ‘until’ or ‘(up) to.’ It occurs before essentially the same words
and phrases as buhat, mula, and umpisa (cf. (¢), above). Nang, however, never follows hanggang. If a
point-time phrase that would be introduced by mang in other contexts follows hanggang, nang is
obligatorily deleted in the case of adverbs referring to the past, or, in the case of adverbs referring to the
future, either deleted or replaced by sa. For example:

Tumira ako roon hanggang 1950.
‘I lived there until 1950.”

(cf. Tumira ako roon nang 1950.
‘I lived there in 1950.’)

Magtatrabaho siya hanggang (sa) Lunes.
‘He will work until Monday.’

(cf. Magtatrabaho siya sa Lunes.
‘He will work on Monday.’)

Some further examples of anggang phrases are: hanggang noong Enero ‘until last January,’ hangeang
bukas ‘until tomorrow,’ hanggang kaninang umaga ‘until this (past) morning.”

(g) The time adverbs that are, either optionally or obligatorily, introduced by the linker na/-ng (when
they occur in non-sentence-initial or non-clause—initial position) comprise a small list of frequency
adverbs. (Cf. §3.11 for a discussion of the linker na/-ng.) Words that occur in frequency adverbs introduced
by na/-ng include: minsan ‘once,’ minsan-minsan ‘sometimes, paminsan-minsan occasionally,’ (paHagi
‘always,’ and madalas ‘often.’ In the case of the three forms that include minsan, the linker is optionally
deletable; it also alternates freely with the marker nang — cf. (a), above. In the case of (pa Jlagi and madalas

Elements sous droits d'auteur
the linker is not deletable. Examples are:

minsan
{ Pedro(ng)
Nagbakasyon si minsan-minsan sa Baguio.
| Manuel (na)
paminsan-minsan
once
“Pedro
sometimes vacationed in Baguio.”
‘Manuel
occasionally
Pedrong ) ( madalas
Nagbabakasyon si sa Baguio.

l Manuel na { | palagi

“Pedro { often
vacations in Baguio.’
“Manuel l atways|

When the above adverbs occur in sentence-initial or clause—initial position (or after the
inversion—marker ay), there is no introductory linker (cf. §6.7): e.g.,

Minsan ay nagbakasyon sj Pedro roon.
‘Pedro once vacationed there.’ (formal style)

If the initial occurrence of the adverb involves non-emphatic adverb inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (4)), the
adverb is followed by the linker na/-ng: c.g.,

Minsang nagbakasyon si Pedro roon.
“Pedro once vacationed there.”

Palaging nagbabakasyon si Pedro roon.
‘Pedro always vacations there.”

(2) UNMARKED TIME ADVERBS. Unmarked time adverbs (i.e., time adverbs that, regardless of
sentence position, lack an introductory marker or linker) may be divided into point—time adverbs and
tecurrent—time adverbs.

Unmarked point—time adverbs include: kamakalawa ‘the day before yesterday,’ kKahapon ‘yesterday,’
kagabi ‘last night,’ ngayon ‘today, now,’ bukas ‘tomorrow,’ and the same K/inja-. . . -an formations that
occur in marked point-time adverbs introduced by sa (cf. subsection (1.b), above; the marked and
unmarked k/in}a-...-an adverbs are identical in meaning; the unmarked adverbs are the more common).
Also included are (ka Jagad ‘right away,” Kanina ‘earlier (in the day),’ mamaya ‘later (in the day),” sandali ‘a
while, a moment,” and sanda-sandali ‘for brief periods.’ (Some speakers use the form Kangina /kani:nah/
instead of, or in free alternation with kanina /kani:nah/.)

The unmarked point~time adverbs Kahapon, kanina, and ngayon occur with the duplicating prefix
dup (cf. §5.16) in formations that connote psychological briefness of time between the time expressed by
the adverb and the moment of speaking. These duplicated formations are obligatorily followed by the
enclitic particle la(mawng (cf. §6.4, subsection (d)), and occur only sentence-initially, in sentences that

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 448

involve ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic inversion (cf. §7.2). Examples of the duplicated
formations in sentences are:

Kaha-kahapon lang ay nandito siya.
‘He was here only yesterday.”

Kani-kanina lamang, masaya siya.
‘Only a while ago, he was happy.’

Ngayon-ngayon lamang natapos ang miting.
‘It’s just now that the meeting ended.’

(There is also a duplicated formation derived from mamaya — viz., maya-maya ‘in a little while,’ as in:

Aalis ako maya-maya.
‘T'll be leaving in a little while.’)

Unmarked recurrent—time adverbs, like recurrent—time adverbs introduced by fuwing (cf. (1.4),
above), are equivalent to English time adverbs that begin with ‘every’; they are formed by duplication of
certain words that express periods of time: e.g., hapon-hapon ‘every afternoon’ (cf. hapon ‘afternoon’).
Some further examples are: @raw-araw ‘every day,’ oras-oras ‘every hour,’ gabi-gabi ‘every night,’
linggo-linggo ‘every week,” buwan-buwun ‘every month, taon-taon ‘every year.’ (There is no *umaga-umaga,
‘every morning’ is expressible only by tuwing umaga.) Any inherently long vowels present in the underlying
time word are retained in both parts of the recurrent—time formation. Thus: fha:punha:pon/ (cf.
f{ha:pon/).

(3) TIME GERUND CONSTRUCTIONS. The formation of gerunds is presented in detail in $3.26.
As is noted in that section, there are two gerund formations corresponding to most actor—focus verbs: an
ASPECTLESS GERUND, which designates an action without indicating whether or not it is viewed as
completed, and a PERFECTIVE GERUND, which designates an action viewed as completed. Pag-alis
‘leaving’ and pag/ka)kaalis ‘having left’ are, for example, respectively the aspectless gerund and the
perfective gerund that correspond to umalis ‘leave.’

Both aspectless and perfective gerunds occur in time gerund constructions. The form of the aspectless
gerund is the same in time gerund constructions as in other contexts; the form of the perfective gerund is
modified in the following ways: (a) the duplicating prefix ka- (/ka/), which is optional in other contexts,
does not occur in time gerund constructions; and (b) the last vowel of the prefix pagka-, which is long in
other contexts, is generally short in time gerund constructions. Thus, for example, the perfective gerund
corresponding to umualis ‘leave,’ which has the form pag(ka)kaalis ({pagka‘‘alis} or /pagkaka‘‘alis/) in other
contexts, has the form pagkaalis /pagka’alis/ in time gerund constructions.

Time gerund constructions with aspectless gerunds are often equivalent to English constructions that
begin with ‘when’ or ‘upon’; those with perfective gerunds, to English constructions that begin with ‘when’
or ‘after.’ For example:

j ‘when he leaves/left’
pag-alis niya

| ‘upon his leaving”

frwhen he has/had left”
pagkaalis niya

(after he leaves/left’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
In time adverbs, as in other cases, the performer of the action expressed by the gerund is designated
either by a following ng phrase (ng plus an unmarked noun, ni(na) plus a personal noun, the ng form of a
deictic or personal pronoun) or by a preceding sa form of a personal pronoun plus the linker -g. Thus:

ng titser { the teacher}
pag-alis ni Maria “when ¢ Maria leaves/left*
noon | that one {

pag-alis niya
‘when he leaves/left”
kaniyang pag-alis

The gerunds may also be followed by any object and/or directional and/or secondary—actor complements
(cf. §2.11 and 5.12) taken by the actor—focus verbs to which they correspond: e.g.,

pag-alis niya roon
‘when he leaves/left there’

(cf. Umialis siya roon.
“He left there.’)

pagpapatigil niya ng kotse sa akin
‘when he has/had me stop the car’

(cf. Nagpatigil siya ng kotse sa akin.
‘He had me stop the car.’)

Some examples of the use of time gerund constructions in sentences are:

Makakatulog
Nakakatulog ang tatay pagsisimula ng opera.
Nakatulog
will fall begins.”
‘Father falls asleep when the opera begins.”
fell began.’

Pangingisda ni Juan, sumasama ang kapatid niya.
‘When Juan goes fishing, his brother goes along.’

Huhugasan ng katulong ang pinggan pagka(pag)walis niya ng sahig.
‘The maid will wash the dishes when she has swept the floor.’

The equivalent of an English construction beginning with ‘as soon as,’ ‘immediately upon,’ or
‘immediately after’ is expressed by a time gerund construction in which the gerund is repeated, with the
two occurrences of the gerund joined by the linker na/-ng: ¢.g.,

pag-alis na pag-alis niya
‘as soon as he leaves/left”
‘immediately upon his leaving”

pagkaalis na pagkaalis niya

‘as soon as he has/had left”
‘immediately after he leaves/left’

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 447

Some examples in sentences are:

\ pagdating na pagdating

Aalis ako nila.
pagkarating na pagkarating
{ arrive.”
‘I'll leave as soon as they
| have arrived.”

Paghinging paghingi
ee ko, ibinigay niya sa akin.

Pagkahinging pagkahingi

{ askea /

‘As soon as I
[naa asked {

for it, he gave it to me.”

(4) EXPANSIONS OF TIME ADVERBS. The names of the days of the week (which occur in various
marked time adverbs disussed under (1), above) and certain unmarked time adverbs (e.g., Kanina ‘earlier,’
mamaya ‘later,’ bukas ‘tomorrow,’ etc. — cf. (2), above) may be expanded by a phrase representing a part
of the day, or by a phrase that expresses clock time. After the names of the days of the week and of
unmarked time adverbs other than kanina, mamaya and ngayon, ang phrase is used: e.g.,

nang
sa Lunes
hapon
noong ng

_—_—

kahapon
bukas

‘on (a)
‘next Monday

afternoon’
‘last

at one o'clock’
‘yesterday
‘tomorrow

After kanina, mamaya, and ngayon, the linker -ng precedes the name of the part of the day or the
clock—time expression: ¢.g.,

kaninang

hapon
mamayang

ala-una
ngayong

‘earlier (in the day)

during the afternoon’
‘later (in the day)

at one o‘clock’
‘today

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
448 CHAPTER 6

(The English translations given above for the constructions with Kanina, mamaya, and ngayon are quite
literal. The more usual English equivalents of kaninang hapon, mamayang hapon, and ngayong hapon
would, in cach case, be ‘this afternoon.’ The Tagalog constructions are, however, not

interchangeable: Kaninang hapon refers to ‘this past afternoon’ and mamayang hapon to ‘this coming
afternoon,’ while ngayong hapon may refer to either of these as well as to ‘this current afternoon.”)

If both the name of a part of the day and a clock time expression are given, the usual order
is: clock--time expression plus name of part of day; the latter is expressed by a ng phrase (cf. §4.4,
subsection (6)): ¢.g.,

sa Lunes ng
bukas ng

ala-una ng hapon
ngayong \
‘next Monday

‘tomorrow at one o'clock in the afternoon’
“today {

(The reverse order — name of part of day plus clock time expression — is possible but rare. When this order
is used, ng precedes the clock—time expression: e.g., ngayong hapon ng ala-una.)

The addition of the particle mga /manah/ to a time adverb normally adds a meaning of
approximateness — equivalent to English ‘about’ or ‘around’ — to the meaning of the adverb itself. (The
approximative particle mga also occurs with cardinal numbers — cf. §4.4; the particle is homonymous with
the pluralizing particle mga discussed in § §3.9 and 4.11). As part of a marked time adverb, mga appears
immediately after the marker: e.g.,

nang mga ala-una ‘at about one o'clock’
sa mga isang linggo ‘in about one week (from now)’
noong mga Lunes ‘about last Monday’

As part of an unmarked time adverb, mga is initial: ¢.g.,
mga kamakalawa ‘about the day before yesterday’

To express the equivalent of an English ‘from ...to...” time expression, a phrase introduced by
hanggang (see (1.f), above) is added to a phrase introduced by buhat, mula, or umpisa (sce (1.¢)). Some
examples are:

buhat (nang) ala-una hanggang alas sais
‘from one o'clock to six o*clock’

mula noong isang buwan hanggang ngayon
‘from last month to today’

umpisa nang 1950 hanggang 1958
‘from 1950 to 1958”

(5) TIME ADVERBS AS PSEUDO-PREDICATES. All of the time adverbs presented above, with
the exception of the time gerund constructions, may occur in predicate position. The topic of a sentence
with a time adverb in predicate position must be one of the following: an unmarked noun that designates a
natural phenomenon (e.g., bagyo ‘storm, lindol ‘earthquake’) or an event or activity (e.g., handaan ‘party,’

 
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 449

trabaho ‘work’), a deictic pronoun (cf. §3.4), a gerund (cf. §3.26), or a nominalized verb base (cf. §3.27).
For example:

ang handaan.

iyon.
Kung Pasko
ang pagbibigyan ng regalo.
ang alis nila.
‘The party )
‘That is (i.e., takes place) at Christmastime.”
‘The exchanging of gifts {

‘It’s at Christmastime that they leave.’

(As is explained in §3,27, a construction involving a time adverb in predicate position opposite a
nominalized verb base alternates freely with a construction involving an emphatic initial adverb (cf. §7.2)
plus an inflected form of a verb, and the adverb carries the same emphatic meaning.)

Time adverbs occurring in predicate position are classified as PSEUDO-PREDICATES, rather than as
genuine predicates, for two reasons: (1) as modifiers in modification constructions (cf. §3.19), time
adverbs function differently from modifiers that are related to genuine predicates: specifically, the linker
naj}-ng is not used with time—adverb modifiers, and the modifier occurs in a fixed position after the head.
Compare, for example:

handaan kung Pasko ‘party at Christmastime’
and:
handaang masaya
“gay party”
masayang handaan

(2) sentences involving time adverbs in predicate position are often understood as implying a deleted verbal
predicate, often a form of mangyari ‘takes place, occur, happen’ or gawin ‘be done, be held’: thus Kung
Pasko ang pagbibigayan ng regalo is equivalent in meaning to Nangyayari kung Pasko ang pagbibigayan ng
regalo ‘The exchanging of gifts takes place at Christmastime,’ and Kung Pasko ang handaan is equivalent in
meaning to Ginagawa kung Pasko ang handaan ‘The party is held at Christmastime.’ (cf. §6.9 for examples
of the functioning of locative adverbs as pseudo—predicates.)

When a time adverb that would be introduced by nang or by the linker na/-ng in non-initial position is
used as a pscudo—predicate, the nang or na/-ng is deleted. Thus:

Ala-una
ang mga miting.
Minsan-minsan

{ at one o'clock.”
‘Mectings take place
l occasionally.”

cf. { Nangyayari nang ala-una
ang mga miting.
l Nangyayaring minsan-minsan j

450 CHAPTER 6

j at one o'clock.’
“Meetings take place
| occasionally.’

Some further examples of sentences involving time adverbs used as pseudo—predicates are:

Noong isang taon ang lindol.
‘The earthquake occurred last year.’

Buong linggo ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta lasts all week.’

Mamayang alas dos ng hapon ang komperensya.
‘The conference will be held at one o'clock this afternoon.’

§ 6.9. Locative adverbs.

Locative adverbs are sa phrases. They represent the place where the action expressed in a sentence
occurs, or where the condition expressed in it prevails. The sa phrases that commonly occur as locative
adverbs include the following: sa plus an unmarked noun; Kina plus a personal noun; sa plus the sa form of
a plural personal pronoun, the sa form of a deictic pronoun. Some examples are:

sa iskwela.
Kumakain
kina Ben.
Diyanitor siya
sa kanila.
May trabaho
toon.
at the school.’
eats

at Ben’s place.”
‘He is a janitor
at their place.’

has a job
there.’

A locative adverb consisting of sa plus an unmarked noun is usually translated by an English ‘at,’ ‘in,” or
‘on’ phrase; a locative adverb consisting of kina plus a personal noun is usually translated by ‘at ’s
(place)’; a locative adverb consisting of sa plus the sa form of a plural personal pronoun is usually translated
by a phrase of the shape ‘at our/your/their place’; the sa form of a deictic pronoun used as a locative adverb
is usually translated by ‘here’ (in the case of dine and dito) or ‘there’ (in the case of diyan and doon). (Sa
phrases of the shapekay plus a personal noun, or of the shape sa plus a singular personal pronoun rarely
occur as locative adverbs.)

In a sentence with a verbal predicate, a sa phrase is sometimes ambiguously interpretable as a locative
adverb or as a directional complement. The sentence Suemulat siya sa mesa is an example of this kind of
ambiguity: it may be interpreted as meaning ‘He wrote at the table,” in which case sa mesa is interpreted as
a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself), in which case sa mesa is
interpreted as a directional complement. (It may be noted that Sumulat siya sa mesa has two different
goal—focus counterparts, each of which is unambiguous: Pinagsulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote at the table’
and Sinulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself).’ The first of these goal—focus
constructions involves the locative—focus counterpart of sumulat (cf. $5.9 for a treatment of locative
focus), while the second involves its directional—focus counterpart.)

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 451

There are also cases in which a sa phrase may be ambiguously interpreted either as a locative adverb
or as a locative adjective phrase (cf. §4.19) modifying a noun. The sentence Mabait ang bata sa iskwela is an
example of this kind of ambiguity: it may mean ‘The child is well—behaved at school,’ in which case sa
iskwela is interpreted as a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘The child (who is) at school is well—behaved,’ in
which case sa iskwela is interpreted as a locative adjective phrase modifying bate. (In the latter
interpretation, bata sa iskwela represents an optional abbreviation of batang nasa iskwela ‘child (who is) at
school’ — cf. §3.14.)

Like the nasa of a locative adjective phrase, the sa of a locative adverb may be followed by a
positional phrase: a phrase consisting of a positional noun plus a ng phrase. (cf. §3.14 for a listing of
positional nouns.) A locative adverb that includes a positional phrase has the same English equivalent(s) as
the corresponding locative adjective phrase. Some examples are:

harap
labas
Nakita ko siya sa ng teatro.
likod
loob

in front of
outside
‘I saw him the theatre.’
in back of
inside

gitna
ibabaw
May kahon sa ng mesa.
ilalim
tabi

in the middle of
on top of

‘There’s a box the table.”
beneath

next to

A locative adverb in which sa is followed by may plus an unmarked noun, positional phrase, etc,
expresses approximate location: e.g.,

Nakita ko sila sa may (harap ng) teatro.
‘I saw them in the vicinity of (the front of) the theater.’

(Cf. $4.19 for the similar use of may in locative adjective phrases.)

Like time adverbs (cf. §6.8, subsection (5)), locative adverbs may occur as pseudo~predicates
Opposite certain types of nouns or nominalizations in topic position. (The topic types that occur opposite
pseudo—predicates as well as the nature of the pseudo—predicate construction itself, are discussed in detail
in §6.8, q.v.) Some examples are:

{ ang parada.
iyon.
ang pagmamartsa.

Sa Abenida Rizal raw

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
452 CHAPTER 6

( the parade
that is (i.e., takes place) on Rizal Avenue.’
the marching

‘They say

Dito ba ang dating ng tren?
‘Is it here that the train arrives?”

§6.10. Manner adverbs.

Manner adverbs characterize the way in which the action expressed by a verb — or by a formation
derived from a verb (e.g., a gerund — cf. §3.26) — is performed. Tagalog manner adverbs may be equivalent
to English adverbs ending in ‘-ly’—e.g., ‘loudly,’ ‘quickly’— or to various other English adverbial
expressions.

Manner adverbs may be divided into three classes, on the basis of whether, when they occur in
non-initial position, they are introduced by: (1) the marker nang: (2) the linker na/-ng; (3) cither the
marker nang or the linker na/-ng. (cf. §6.7 for a discussion of the marker nang, and §3.11 for a discussion
of the linker na/-ng.)

(1) Included in this class are constructions in which nang is followed by: (a) a member of a subclass
of unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2); (b) a member of a subclass of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3); (c) a grouping
numeral (cf. §4.5, subsection (e)); (d) an adjective phrase expressing resemblance of one of the following
types: gaya plus a ng phrase; a contraction derived from gaya and the ng form of a deictic (i.e., ganire,
ganito, ganyon, or ganoon), or such a contraction plus a ka- adjective formation (cf. §4.18). (The unaffixed
adjectives and ma- adjectives that occur in manner adverbs are those whose meaning is compatible with
characterizing the way in which an action is performed. Most of these same adjectives — or their
bases — may occur in a ka- adjective formation (after ganire, etc.) within a manner adverb. As is noted in
§4.18, some speakers use the linker -ng before the ka- formation, while others do not.) Some examples are:

) Lumakad ang pari nang banayad (na banayad).
‘The priest walked at a (very) moderate pace.’
(an adjective within a manner adverb may be expanded in the usual ways — e.g., through the
use of an intensive construction, as in the above example.)

Binuksan ni Fred ang pintuan nang bigla.
‘Fred opencd the door suddenly.”

(b) Kailangan nating kumain nang mabilis.
“We must eat quickly.”

Bawal ang magsalita nang malakas dito.
‘Speaking loudly is forbidden here.”

(c)  Binilang niya ang mangga nang dala-dalawa.
‘He counted the mangoes by twos.’

Papasok tayo sa kuwarto nang isa-isa.
‘We'll enter the room one by one.’

(d) Kumanta ang mga bata nang gaya ng mga ruwisenyor.
‘The children sang like nightingales.’

Nakakapagod ang pagsayaw nang ganoon.
‘Dancing like that makes one tired.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 453

Hindi ka dapat magmancho nang ganito(ng) kabilis.

{ this fast,’
‘You shouldn’t drive
l as fast as this one.’

(The ambiguity of constructions like ganito(ng) kabilis, noted in §4.18, is present in manner
adverbs that involve the constructions.)

(2) Included in this class are constructions in which the linker na/-ng is followed by: (a) an adjective
phrase expressing resemblance, consisting of parang (para plus the linker -ng) plus a nominal (cf. §4.18); (b)
the imperfective form of an actor—focus verb (cf. §5.21). Some examples are:

(a) Sumigaw si Manuel na parang luku-luko.
‘Manuel shouted like a madman.’

Lumalakad si Neneng parang mananayaw.
‘Nene walks like a dancer.’

(b) Bakit siya umalis na umiiyak?
“Why did she leave crying?”

Lumabas doong tumatakbo ang bata.
‘The child came running out of there.’

(3) Included in this class are constructions in which either the marker nang or the linker na/-ng is
followed by a pa- manner adjective (cf. §4.7). Some examples are:

{ nang }
Ang alimango’y lumalakad { patagilid.
na

‘The crab walks sideways.’

ako nang

Binati niya pangiti.
akong

‘He greeted me smilingly.’

Manner adverbs do not occur initially in ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic adverb
inversion, but do occur initially in non-emphatic adverb inversion, in which case they are linked to what
follows by the linker na/-ng (cf. §7.2, subsection (4)).

As is noted in §6.7, a nang or linker that introduces a non-initial adverb is dropped when the adverb
occurs in initial position. Some examples are:

Biglang binuksan ni Fred ang pintuan.
‘Fred opened the door suddenly.”

Gaya ng mga ruwisenyor na kumanta ang mga bata.
‘The children sang like nightingales.’

§6.11. Other movable adverbs.

In addition to time adverbs, locative adverbs, and manner adverbs (cf. §§6.8, 6.9, and 6.10
respectively), Tagalog has movable adverbs of a number of other kinds. These adverbs are presented below
under the following headings: (1) adverbs with non-initial sa phrases; (2) sa... ng adverbs; (3) sang
Measurement adverbs; (4) miscellaneous movable adverbs.

(1) ADVERBS WITH NON-INITIAL sa PHRASES. Members of this class of adverbs consist of an
introductory word followed by a sa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun, nominalization, or sa-form personal
pronoun, kay or kina plus a personal noun; or a sa-form deictic pronoun.) The class includes: (a)
BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE, and other adverbs introduced by para; (b) CAUSATIVE ADVERBS; (c)
REFERENTIAL ADVERBS; (d) other adverbs with non-initial sa phrases.

(a) BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE and other adverbs introduced by para. In both benefactive and
purpose adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by para. In benefactive adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase
is usually a noun or pronoun; in purpose adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase is a gerund (cf. §3.26).
Both types of adverbs are normally translatable by English ‘for’ phrases, and both are similar in form and
meaning to certain adjective phrases (cf. §4.20, subsections (1) to (3)).

Benefactive adverbs may express either the meaning ‘for the benefit (or use) of ...° or ‘acting in
place of ...’. Thus the sentence:

Ginawa niya ang trabaho para sa iyo.
‘He did the work for you.”

is capable of being interpreted in either of two ways: ‘He did the work for your benefit’ or ‘He did the
work, acting in your place.’ And the sentence:

Bibilhin mo ba iyon para sa akin?
‘Will you buy that for me?’

may mean either ‘Will you buy that for my use?’ or ‘Will you buy that, acting in my place?’
The nominal within a benefactive adverb often corresponds to the topic of a benefactive—focus verb
(cf. §5.7). Some examples are:

{ Sumulat ka ng liham para sa skin}
Isulat mo ako ng liham.
“Write a letter for me.”

{ Nagluto siya ng adobo para sa mga bisita.
Ipinagluto niya ng adobo ang mga bisita.
‘She cooked adobo for the guests.”

Purpose adverbs express the meanings ‘for the purpose’ of ...°, ‘for use in. ..°, etc. Some examples
are:

Kunin mo ang perang ito para sa pag-aaral mo.
‘Take this money for your studies.”
(More literally: ‘for your studying’)

Bumili siya ng walis para sa paglilinis niya ng bahay.
‘She bought a broom to clean the house with.’

Both benefactive and purpose adverbs are sometimes ambiguously interpretable as modifying adjectival
phrases. (As is noted in §3.14, the linker na/-ng is optionally deletable before a modifying phrase
introduced by para.) Thus in the sentence:

Iniinit ng Nanay ang pagkain para kay Nene.
‘Mother is heating the food for Nene.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
tS SSS SSS SSS ST
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 455

The para sa phrase may be interpreted either as a benefactive adverb (in which case it means ‘for Nene’s
benefit’ or ‘acting in place of Nene’) or as an adjectival (in which case it means ‘which was for Nene’).
Similarly in:

Bumili ako ng alak para sa pagluluto.
‘I bought some wine for (the) cooking.’

the para sa phrase may be interpreted cither as a purpose adverb (in which case it means ‘in order to cook’)
or as an adjectival (in which case it means ‘which was for cooking’).

In addition to benefactive and purpose adverbs, para plus a sa phrase forms adverbs of various other
types, all of them equivalent to ‘for’ phrases in English. Some examples are:

Bumalik siya sa opisina para sa sulat.
‘He returned Co the office for the letter.’

Pumunta sila sa bayan para sa pista.
‘They went to town for the fiesta.’

Bumili ako ng karne para sa sopas.
‘I bought some meat for the soup.”

(b) CAUSATIVE ADVERBS. In causative adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by dahil. The adverbs
are translatable by English phrases introduced by ‘because of or ‘as a result of.’ Some examples are:

Pinili siya dahil sa kakayahan niya.
“He was chosen because of his ability."

Nagkahiwalay sila dahil sa kaniyang paglalasing.
‘They separated because of his drinking.”

The nominal within a causative adverb often corresponds to the topic of a causative—focus verb (cf. §5.8).
Some examples are:

{ Namatay siya dahil sa gutom. }
Ikinamatay niya ang gutom.
‘He died (as a result) of hunger.’

{ Nainis siya dahil doon.
Ikinainis niya iyon.
“He was annoyed because of that.’

In addition to nouns, pronouns, and nominalizations, the sa of a causative adverb may be followed by
certain formations consisting of ka- /ka‘/ plus a duplicating syllable plus a verb base. The formation of the
duplicating syllable follows the rules given for dup, in §3.7. Inherent length in the verb base is

retained: e¢.g., kalalakad /ka‘lala‘kad/ ‘walking too much’ (cf. Iumakad fluma‘kad/ ‘walk’). These
formations, which express a meaning of excessive performance of the activity denoted by the base, occur

only in causative adverbs, and do not occur as topics of causative—focus verbs. Some examples in sentences
are:

Napagod siya dahil sa kalalakad.
‘He got tired as a result of walking too much.’

Nagkasakit siya dahil sa kabibilad sa araw.
‘He became ill as a result of too much exposure to the sun.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
456 CHAPTER 6

The dahil of a causative adverb is optionally deletable before sa plus a Xa- formation of the type just
described. Thus, also:

Napagod siya sa kalalakad.
Nagkasakit siya sa kabibilad sa araw.

Dahil is also optionally deletable in some other cases. Namatay siya sa gutom, for example, is identical in
meaning with Namatay siya dahil sa gutom ‘He died (as a result) of hunger.” In still other cases, however,
dahil must be retained. Thus the dahil of Nagkahiwalay sila dahil sa kaniyang paglalasing. ‘They separated
because of his drinking’ is not deletable.

(In literature, the dahil of a causative adverb is sometimes replaced by sah, as in:

Nagpakamatay ang prinsesa sanhi sa kataksilan ng prinsipe.
‘The princess killed herself because of the prince’s faithlessness.”)

(c) REFERENTIAL ADVERBS. In referential adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by tungkol, hinggil,
or ukol. (As in the case of referential adjective phrases — cf. §4.20, subsection (5) — rungkol is the most
common of the three in ordinary conversation.) The adverbs are normally translatable by English adverbs
introduced by ‘about,’ where ‘about’ connotes ‘on the subject of.’ Some examples are:

tungkol

Nagsinungaling siya hinggil sa mga gawain niya.
ukol

‘He lied about his activities.”

Nag-usap kami tungkol sa handaan.
“We talked about the party.”

The nominal within a referential adverb often corresponds to the topic of a referential—focus verb
(cf. §5.10). Some examples are:

{ Nagkwento siya tungkol sa evan}
Ikinuwento niya ang giyera.
‘He told a story about the war.’

{tassasons ako sa kaniya tungkol sa Amerika.
Itinanong ko sa kaniya ang Amerika.
‘Lasked him about America.’

(d) OTHER ADVERBS WITH NON-INITIAL sa PHRASES. Adverbs that consist of the words listed
below plus a sa phrase are normally equivalent to English adverbs introduced by the expressions shown to
their right:

alang-alang ‘for the sake of
alinsunod ‘in accordance with’
ayon ‘according to”
bukod ‘as well as, besides’

ClAmante ene Arnite Ain
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 457

buhat ‘from’
(ma)liban
(ma)tangi ‘except (for)

Examples in sentences follow:

Nagpakasakit siya alang-alang sa kaniyang pamilya.
‘He made a sacrifice for the sake of his family.’

Nagbabayad ako ng buwis alinsunod sa patakaran.
‘I pay taxes in accordance with the regulation.’

Uulan (daw) bukas, ayon sa diyaryo.
‘It’s going to rain tomorrow, according to the newspaper.”

(The enclitic particle daw/raw ‘it is said’ — cf. §6.4, subsection (e) — is frequently, but not obligatorily,
used in sentences that include adverbs introduced by ayon.)

Tumanggap siya ng medalya, bukod sa mga aklat.
‘He received a medal as well as the books.”

Maglakad tayo buhat dito.
‘Let’s walk from here.’

(Buhat also occurs in time adverbs — cf. §6.8, subsection (1.e).)

(ma)liban
Narito na ang lahat kay Jose.

(ma)tangi
‘Everyone is here now except Jose.”

(2) Sa...ng... ADVERBS.. These adverbs consist of sa, plus one of a limited list of words (see
below), plus a mg phrase (ng plus an unmarked noun or nominalization, ni or nina plus a personal noun, or
the ng form of a personal or deictic pronoun). Among the common sa... mg... adverbs are the following:

halip
sa ng ‘instead of, in place of
lugar
sa pag-iingat ng ‘in the care of”
sa pagtataguyod ng ‘in the interest of (supporting)’
sa pagtatanggol ng ‘in defense of
$a pamamagitan ng ‘through, by means of

Some examples in sentences follow:

‘I'll do the cleaning instead of Tita.”

Iniwan ang bata sa pag-iingat ng kaniyang lola.
‘The child was left in the care of his grandmother.’

Magtulungan tayo sa pagtataguyod ng kandidato natin.
‘Let’s help one another in the interest of our candidate.”

Namatay sila sa pagtatanggol ng bayan.
‘They died in defense of the country.”

Nagtagumpay siya sa pamamagitan ng masikap na paggawa.
‘He succeeded by means of hard work,”

Inilagay niya ang Kalakal sa pamamahala ng kapatid niya.
‘He put the business under the supervision of his brother.’

Ipinagbili niya ang lupa niya sa payo ng kaibigan niya.
‘He sold his land on the advice of his friend.’

Nakapag-aral siya sa tulong ng pamilya niya.
‘He was able to go to school with the help of his family.’

(3) Nang MEASUREMENT ADVERBS.
Nang measurement adverbs consist of the marker nang plus an expression of measurement. Examples

are:

nang apat na yarda ‘four yards’
nang tatlong oras ‘three hours”
nang limang libra ‘five pounds’
nang malaki ‘alot’

Nang measurement adverbs occur with a limited set of intransitive -ur- verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6,
class J). The verbs express measurable changes; the nang adverbs that occur with them express the extent of
the change. Examples in sentences are:

Lumaki siya nang tatlong pulgada.
‘He grew (i.e., became bigger by) three inches.’

Tumagal ang pista nang isang linggo.
‘The feast lasted (i.e., became long) one week.’

Bumigat na nang walang onsa ang sanggol.
‘The baby has already gained (i.e., become heavier by) eight ounces.”

Nang measurement adverbs correspond to predicates that occur opposite nominalized

measurement—focus verbs (cf. § 5.10).
(4) MISCELLANEOUS MOVABLE ADVERBS. Among the other common movable adverbs of
Tagalog may be noted the following: phrases consisting of bilang plus a nominal, equivalent to English

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 459

adverbs introduced by ‘as (a form of) or ‘by way of": the fixed phrases Aung ganoon ‘in that case,” sa
biglang/madaling sabi ‘in short,’ sa wakas ‘in the end’; the words halos ‘almost,’ marahil ‘probably,’ seguro
‘maybe,’ ulift} and muli ‘again.’ (Uli(t) and muli ate optionally preceded by the linker -ng- in non-initial
position.) Illustrative sentences follow:

Inilabas niya ang liham bilang katibayan.
‘He brought out the letter by way of proof.”

Ako mismo ang gagawa, kung ganoon.
‘T'll do it myself, in that case.”

biglang

Wala kang magagawa kundi umalis, sa sabi.
madaling

‘You have no choice but to leave, in short.”

Inihalal nila siyang presidente, sa wakas.
‘They elected him president, in the end.’

Namatay siya halos.
‘He almost died.’

Hindi sisipot marahil si Totoy.
‘Totoy probably won’t come.’

Mag-aaral siya seguro mamayang gabi.
‘Maybe he’ll study tonight.

uli(t).
Basahin mo(ng)

muli.
‘Read it again.’

§6.12. Initial adverbs.

Tagalog has a number of adverbs that always occur in sentence—initial or clause—initial position.
These adverbs may be divided into four classes. Members of classes (1), (2), and (3) are followed,
respectively, by: (1) a pause; (2) either a pause or the inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2); (3) the linker na/-ng
(cf. §3.11). Members of class (4) are immediately followed by the rest of the sentence or clause, with no
intervening pause, marker, or linker.

(1) The only member of this class is the rhetorical linker £, which expresses a sequential or logical
connection between the sentence it introduces and some preceding utterance or pre-existing situation. It is
often equivalent to English ‘and,’ ‘well,’ or ‘why.’ Some examples of its use are:

E, magkano naman ito?
‘And how much is this one?’

Napapagod ka? E, magpahinga ka.
You're tired? Well, get some rest.’

E, isip ko’y nasa iyo ang mga tiket.
‘Why, I thought you had the tickets.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
460 CHAPTER 6

(As is noted in $1.24, E takes a distinctive intonation pattern (pattern 1.4). See below for the use of E with
the class (4) initial adverb di.)
(2) Initial adverbs that may be followed either by a pause or by ay include:

alalaong baga ‘in other words’
kasi

‘the reason is...”
mangyari
gayon man ‘nevertheless’
samantala ‘meanwhile’

Some examples in sentences are:

baga,

Alalaong ayaw mong gawin.
baga’y

‘In other words, you don’t want to do it.”

Kasi,
Kasi ay.
(Hindi ako makakaalis.) may sakit ang anak ko.
Mangyari,
Mangyari ay.
“(I can't leave.) The reason is, my child is sick.’

man, )
(Lumang-luma na ang kotse.) Gayon bibilhin pa rin niya.

man ay f
(‘The car is already very old.) Nevertheless, he will (still) buy it.”

Samantala,

susuriin ko ito.
Samantala’y
‘Meanwhile, I'll examine this.”

(3) Initial adverbs followed by the linker na/-ng include:

baka sakali ‘perhaps’
(pam)bihira ‘seldom’
totoo ‘it’s true that’

Some examples are:

(Magtanong ka kay Juan). Baka sakaling alam niya ang sagot.
“Ask Juan. Perhaps he knows the answer.”

Pambihirang}
umulan dito.

Bihirang

‘It seldom rains here.”

Totoo raw na magiging kandidato siya.
‘They say it’s true that he will be a candidate.”

SSeS
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 461

(4) Initial adverbs that are immediately followed by the rest of the sentence include:

baka (expression of conjecture or anxiety)
di ‘then’
tila ‘it seems”

(Baka and tila are optionally non-pre-enclitic. Di is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic. Cf. §3.29.)
When it introduces a sentence with a nominal or adjectival predicate, or a predicate that includes an

aspect—marked verb form, baka expresses conjecture. Some examples are:

Baka magkaibigan sila.
“Maybe they’re friends.’

Baka mabuti iyon.
‘That might be good.’

Baka nabasag ang baso.
‘It’s possible that the glass got broken.’

Baka also occurs in a special construction in which it is followed by the basic form of a verb (cf. $2.8) used
as a predicate. This construction expresses anxiety on the part of the speaker about a possible undesired
occurrence. Some examples are:

Baka mabasag ang baso. ‘I’m afraid that the glass may get broken.’
Baka umulan bukas. ‘I’m afraid it may rain tomorrow.”

The adverb di (which is a different word from the negator di — cf. §7.13) is commonly preceded by
the class (1) initial adverb, E (see above): e.g.,

E. di gagawin ko agad.
“Well then, I'll do it right away.”

It may, however, occur without E: e.g.,

Di gagawin ko agad.
‘Then I'll do it right away.”

An example of the use of tila is:

Tila magkakaroon ng parti bukas.
‘It seems there’s going to be a party tomorrow.”

§ 6.13. Sentence—final particles.

Tagalog has four particles — a, e, ha, and o — which occur only in sentence—final position. All four
are conventionally written with a preceding comma, but only Aa and o form separate intonation phrases (cf.
§1.24, patterns 1.2 through 1.5); @ and e are always included in a single intonation phrase with what
precedes them (cf. §1.27, pattern [V.1).

A is used in sentences that express an event or situation that is contrary to expectation: either the
speaker's own expectation (in which case the sentence often includes the enclitic particle pala ~ cf. §6.5,
subsection (b)) or that of the person(s) addressed. A is often equivalent to an initial ‘but’ in English. Some

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
462

examples are:

Ayun (pala) sila, a!

(‘Oh,) but there they are!’

Maganda pala ito, a!
‘Oh, but this is pretty!”

Hindi na sila nakatira doon, a.
“But they don’t live there any more.”

CHAPTER 6

Ehas three main uses. Accompanying an explanation, it is equivalent to English ‘it’s because’ or ‘you
see’; accompanying a contradiction of something said by another speaker (in which case the sentence often
includes the enclitic particle nga — cf. §6.4, subsection (b.3)), it is equivalent to ‘on the contrary’, in other
cases (particularly in answer to questions), it expresses regret or sympathy, and may be equivalent to

‘unfortunately.’ Some examples are:

(Bakit hindi ka kumakain?)
“Why aren’t you eating?’

(Hindi ko nabili.)
(I couldn’t buy it.’)

(Matalino ka, hindi ba?)
(You're intelligent, aren’t you?’)
(Mayayaman ang mga Santos.)

(‘The Santoses are rich.”)

(Kumusta si Juan?)
(‘How is Juan?’)

(Nakabili ka na ba ng kotse?)
(‘Have you bought a car?’)

Busog pa ako, ¢.
‘It’s because I’m still full.’

Kulang ang pera ko, ¢.
‘I didn’t have enough money, you see.’

Ikaw (nga) ang matalino, ¢.
‘On the contrary, you’re the
intelligent one.’

Mahihirap (nga) sila, ¢.
‘On the contrary, they’re poor.’

May sakit siya, e.
*He’s sick, unfortunately.”

Hindi pa, e.
‘Not yet.”

Ha is used only in informal contexts, in utterances directed toward people with whom one uses the
second—person-singular pronoun (cf. §3.3). Ha may be added to a question, a command or request, or one
of several types of social formulas (cf. §7.22). In these uses, Aa expresses importunity. Examples are:

Aalis ka na ba, ha?

(After a question or a request, fa always carries a rising intonation pattern (pattern 1.3, §1.24: /2t/); after
a command or social formula, it carries either this pattern or a sustained pattern (pattern 1.4, $1.24: /2>/).
When it carries the rising pattern, Aa may express different degrees of importunity, according to whether it
is spoken at normal speed or slowly, with the vowel dzawled. Mild importunity is expressed when ha is
spoken at normal speed, a greater degree of importunity when it is spoken slowly.)

Ha is also used to suggest sarcasm or a challenge to an assertion made by the person addressed. (In
these uses /ia carries either a falling intonation pattern (pattern 1.2: /2$/) or one of several sustained
patterns (patterns 1.4 and 1.5: {/2>/ and /1->/).) Examples are:

Marunong ka, ha?
‘You think you're smart, don’t you?”

Hindi ka ba papasok, ha?
‘So you're not going to school?’ (We'll just see about that!’)

O is used in informal situations either after a polite request that includes nga (cf. §5.29), in which
case it increases the urgency of the request, or to direct the attention of the person(s) addressed, in which
case it is equivalent to English ‘Look!’ (After a request, o carries a sustained intonation pattern (pattern
1.5: /1>/); as an attention director, it carries either this pattern or a rising pattern (pattern 1.3: /2t/).)
Examples are:

Tulungan mo nga ako, o.
‘Come on, help me, please.’

Ayusin mo nga ito, 0.
“How about fixing this, please.’

Ayun si Juan, o!
‘Look, there’s Juan!’

Basag ang baso, o.
‘Look, the glass is broken.’

§ 6.14. Adverbial clauses: introduction.

A clause is a part of a sentence that itself has essentially the same internal structure as a sentence. An
ADVERBIAL CLAUSE is a clause that occurs in the same sentence contexts as an adverbial, and that has a
similar semantic function. (For a presentation of other clause types that occur in Tagalog, cf. §§3.28
(nominal clauses), 7.19 (coordinate clauses), and 7.20 (explanatory AT clauses).)

Most Tagalog adverbial clauses are introduced by a SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTION, a word or
phrase whose function is to specify the precise adverbial relation of the clause they introduce to the rest of
the sentence. (Cf. §6.17, subsections (4) and (5), however, for a presentation of adverbial—clause types
that lack a subordinating conjunction, the adverbial relation being expressed, instead, by enclitic particles.)

A sentence that includes an adverbial clause may be called a COMPLEX SENTENCE. A complex
sentence always includes, in addition to the adverbial clause, a MAIN CLAUSE: a clause that is not
introduced by a subordinating conjunction, and that, unlike the adverbial clause, is capable of occurring
independently as a complete sentence. For example, in the complex sentence:

Pupunta siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng Tatay.
‘He will go to Manila if Father gives him permission.”

the main clause is Prpunta siya sa Maynila ‘he will go to Manila’ the subordinate clause, Kung papayagan

siya ng Tatay ‘if Father gives him permission.’ (In those few complex—sentence types that involve enclitic
particles rather than subordinating conjunctions, the distinction between the main clause and the adverbial

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
464 CHAPTER 6

clause is not always perfectly clear, since both clauses are usually marked by enclitic particles, and both
may in most cases occur independently.)
An adverbial clause may occur cither before or after the main clause. Thus, also:

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.”

If the adverbial clause precedes the main clause, it normally constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is
followed by a pause (represented in conventional writing by a comma). A sentence with an initial adverbial
clause followed by a pause involves contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (2)), and, potentially at least,
carries contrastive meaning. The above sentence, for example, might occur in a context such as:

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
Kung hindi siya papayagan, mamamalagi siya rito.

‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.

‘If he isn’t given permission, he will stay here.”

Less commonly, an initial adverbial clause is followed by the inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2, subsection (1)):

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay ay pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘He will go to Manila if Father gives him permission.’ (formal style)

Each clause in a complex sentence may be said to be derived from an underlying sentence. The
underlying sentences represented in the above illustrations are, for example:

Pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘He will go to Manila.”

and:

Papayagan siya ng Tatay.
‘Father will give him permission.’

In cases where the complex sentence includes only one intonation phrase (i.e., in cases where there is no
pause between the clauses), the intonation pattern of the sentence underlying the main clause serves as the
intonation pattern of the entire complex sentence. Thus Pupunta siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng
Tatay has the same statement intonation (or the same range of possible statement intonations) as Pupunta
siya sa Maynila. Similarly, the complex sentences:

Pupunta ba siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng Tatay?
‘Will he go to Manila if Father gives him permission?”

and:

Ano ang gagawin niya kung papayagan siya ng Tatay?
‘What will he do if Father gives him permission?’

have, respectively, the yes—no—question intonation and information--question intonation of the sentences
that underlie their main clauses.

In cases where the adverbial clause is initial and is followed by a pause (i.e., in contrastive inversion),
the adverbial clause is given an appropriate non-final intonation pattern, while the main clause retains the
intonation pattern of the sentence that underlies it. Thus the final clauses of the following sentences have,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 465

respectively, statement, yes—no—question, and information—question intonation:

Kung papayagan siya ng Talay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.’

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta ba siya sa Maynila?
‘If Father gives him permission, will he go to Manila?’

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, ano ang gagawin niya?
‘If Father gives him permission, what will he do?’

(For a summary of the intonation patterns that occur in statements, yes—no questions, and information
questions, cf. §1.28. For a more detailed treatment of the intonation of contrastive—inversion
constructions, cf. §7.2, subsection (2).)

While main clause normally retains the form of the sentence that underlies it, the adverbial clause
may in some cases represent an altered form of the underlying sentence. The most common altcration that
occurs in adverbial clauses is a change in the form of a verbal predicate. Some subordinating conjunctions
may be followed by basic verb forms (cf. §2.8) as well as by the inflected forms that occur in independent
sentences. An example is the subordinating conjunction bago ‘before,’ as in:

{ matulog
Bago ang mga bata, nagkuwento ako sa kanila.
natulog

‘Before the children went to bed, I told them a story.”

(cf. Natulog ang mga bata.
‘The children went to bed.’
but not: *Matulog ang mga bata.)

Other subordinating conjunctions may be followed only by basic verb forms, never by inflected
forms. An example is para ‘so that,” as in:

Kumain na tayo para makarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
‘Let’s eat now so that I'll be able to get to the station early.’

There is no:

*Kumain na tayo para makakarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
(cf. Makakarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
‘T'll be able to get to the station early.’)

There is also a type of alteration that may affect either the adverbial clause or the main clause,
whichever happens to be non-initial: viz., the topic of the non-initial clause is commonly deleted when its
referent is the same as that of the initial clause. In such cases, if the topic is capable of being expressed by a
personal pronoun (i.e., if it represents a human being or pet animal — cf. §3.3), this pronoun may or may
not occur in the non-initial clause: ¢.g.,

Hindi pupunta si Juan sa miting kung pagod (siya).
Kung pagod si Juan, hindi (siya) pupunta sa miting.

‘Juan won’t go to the meeting if he’s tired.’
‘If Juan is tired, he won't go to the meeting.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
466 CHAPTER 6

If the topic is not capable of being expressed by a personal pronoun, the non-initial clause is normally
topicless: e.g.,

Hindi ko bibilhin ang damit kung mahal.
Kung mahal ang damit, hindi ko bibilhin.

‘I won't buy the dress if it’s expensive.’
‘If the dress is expensive, | won’t buy it.’

(Tagalog has no equivalent of English ‘it’ for referring pronominally to inanimate objects — cf. §3.3.)

As is noted in §3.29, subsection (1.A.8), the majority of subordinating conjunctions are obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic (i.e., are never immediately followed by enclitic pronouns or particles). A small number of
subordinating conjunctions are, however, optionally pre-enclitic, and at least two, bago ‘before’ and kundi
‘if... not,’ are obligatorily pre-enclitic (cf. §3.29, subsection (II.A.7)). In subsequent sections special
attention is called to those subordinating conjunctions that are optionally or obligatorily pre-enclitic.

Tagalog adverbial clauses are presented in subsequent sections as follows: time and conditional
clauses in §6.15; cause, result, and purpose clauses in §6.16; concessive clauses in §6.17; other adverbial
clauses in §6.18. (cf. also §7.18 for a presentation of indefinite adverbial clauses.)

§6.15. Time and conditional clauses.

Tagalog time clauses and conditional clauses are conveniently presented together, since there are two
subordinating conjunctions, (ka/pag(ka) and kung, that introduce clauses whose English equivalents are in
some cases time clauses (introduced by ‘when’), in others conditional clauses (introduced by ‘if), and in
still others cither time clauses or conditional clauses. In addition to (ka)pag(ka) and kung, there is one other
subordinating conjunction, (kung) sakali, that introduces conditional clauses, and there are various other
subordinating conjunctions that introduce time clauses. These time clauses are divisible into four main
classes on the basis of the types of predicates that may occur within them. One class accepts either verbless

(i.e., nominal or adjectival) or inflected—verbal predicates; a second accepts either verbless or basic—form
predicates; a third accepts either inflected or basic—form predicates; and a fourth accepts verbless,

inflected, or basic—form predicates.

Tagalog time and conditional clauses are presented below under the following headings. (The
subordinating conjunctions that introduce clauses belonging to the various classes are listed alphabetically
in parentheses after each heading. If a conjunction is analyzable as including a linker (-ng or na/-ng the
linker is written separately, after a plus sign.)

(1) Timefconditional clauses ((Ka/pag(ka), kung, (Kung) sakali + naj-ng)

(2) Clauses with verbless or inflected predicates (haba + na/-ng, hangga't, miyentras { + naj-ng),

noon + ng or naf-ng, ngayon at, ngayon + naf-ng, samantala + naj-ng, tuwi + naf-ng)

(3) Clauses with verbless or basic—form predicates (oras na, sa sandali + na/-ng)

(4) Clauses with inflected or basic—form predicates (bago, hanggang (sa), matapos + -ng or naf-ng,

pagkatapos + ng or na/-ng)

(5S) Clauses with verbless, inflected, or basic—form predicates ((mag)buhat nang, (mag}mula nang,

nang)

(1) TIME/CONDITIONAL CLAUSES. Clauses in this class are introduced by (ka)pag/ka), kung, or
(kung) sakali + naf-ng. (The notation (ka)pag/ka) represents any of the following forms: pag /pag/, kKapag
{kapag/, pagka /pagka’/, kapagka /kapagka‘/. Of these pag is the most common. The notation (kung) sakali
represents kung sakali and sakali. ) (Ka)pag(ka) introduces clauses with verbless or inflected predicates; kung
and (kung) sakali + na/-ng introduce, in addition to these, clauses with basic—form predicates.

Only kung is used in clauses that express a condition that is contrary to fact. The contrary—to-fact
clause may have either a verbless or an inflected predicate. The main clause normally includes the enclitic

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 467

particle sana (cf. §6.5, subsection (¢)), which makes the contrary—to—fact meaning of the kung clause
explicit. Some examples are:

Kung nandito si Rosa, mas masaya sana tayo.
‘If Rosa were here, we would be happier.”

Kung ako si Juan, hindi ko sana ginawa iyon.
‘If T were Juan, I would not have done that.’

Kung aalis ako bukas, binabalot ko sana ang aking kagamitan ngayon.
‘If I were leaving tomorrow, I’d be packing my things today.’

Tumatanggap sana siya ng mabuting marka kung nag-aaral siya.
“He'd be getting a good grade if he were studying.”

Gumaling ka sana agad kung ininom mo ang gamot na ito.
‘You'd have recovered right away if you had taken this medicine.’

Kung (hin)di
) (lamang) napakalayo ng Maynila, papag-aaralin
j ko sana siya roon.
Kundi

‘If (only) Manila weren’t so far away, I’d send him to school there.’

(In contrary—to--fact clauses, kundi ‘if... not’ is an optional contraction of kung and di (itself an
abbreviation of hindi ‘not’ — cf. §7.13). It is often followed by the enclitic particle lamang ‘only’ (cf. §6.4,
subsection (d)). The contraction does not occur in Kung clauses of other types. As is noted in §3.29,
subsection (II.A.7), kundi is obligatorily pre-enclitic. There is a homonymous coordinating conjunction,
kundi ‘but, except,’ which is presented in §7.20.)

Except in the case of clauses that express a condition contrary to fact, Aung and (Ka)pag/ka) are
interchangeable when the clause they introduce has a verbless or an imperfective—aspect verbal predicate.
Such a clause may be equivalent to an English ‘when’ clause (where the ‘when’ clause represents a recurrent
or repeatable situation or action), or to cither an ‘if or a ‘when’ clause. Whatever the English equivalent,
the Tagalog clause expresses a situation or action that is wholly or partly concurrent with that expressed in
the main clause. Some examples are:

(Ka)pag(ka) )

| hindi mo kailangan ito, itatago ko na.

Kung

‘If you don’t need this, Ill put it away now.”
{ (ka)pag(ka)

Maasim ang prutas na ito hilaw.
| kung

‘This fruit is sour when it’s unripe.’

(Ka)pag(ka) )

‘Kung \

‘If/When the weather is good, we go to the seashore.”

‘I won’t play the piano if Father is sleeping.’
(Ka)pag(ka)

Kung

‘When Juan speaks Tagalog, we laugh.”

{ (kaypag(ka)
Madalas silang dumadalaw sa Lola lumalakad sila buhat sa iskwela.
kung

‘They often visit Grandmother if/when they walk from school.”

(Kung) sakali+na/-ng is not used to introduce a clause with an imperfective—aspect (or a
perfective—aspect) verbal predicate, but may introduce a clause with a verbless predicate, provided the main
clause has a predicate verb in the contemplated aspect. The (Kung) sakali + na/-ng clause is equivalent to an
English clause introduced by ‘if’ or ‘in case’: ¢.g.,

(Kung) sakaling mabuti ang panahon, pupunta kami sa tabing-dagat.
‘If

the weather is good, we'll go to the seashore.”

‘In case (

A clause in which (ka /pag(ka) is followed by a perfective—aspect predicate represents an action to be
completed in the future, prior to the action expressed in the main clause. The (ka)pag/ka) clause is usually

translatable by either an ‘if’ clause or a ‘when’ clause. Examples are:

(Ka)pag(ka) nakita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
“If/When I see him, I'll tell him what happened.’

Bumili ka ng gatas (ka)pag(ka) nagpunta ka sa palengke.
“Buy some milk if/when you go to the market.”

Essentially the same meaning may be expressed by a Aung or (kung) sakali +na/-ng clause with a
contemplated—aspect predicate, except that in these clauses the conditional nature of the action is more
explicit, the English equivalent of the Aung clause normally having ‘if,’ that of the (kung) sakali + na/-ng
clause normally having ‘in case’:

Kung
makikita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kanya ang nangyari.
(Kung) sakaling
‘If }
I see him, I’ll tell him what happened.’
‘In case j

‘Buy some milk you go to the market.”
in case {

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 469

((Kajpag(ka}) does not occur in a clause with a comtemplated—aspect predicate. When kung occurs in a
clause with a perfective—aspect predicate, the clause usually expresses a condition contrary to fact (see
above), but may also express a simple condition in the past: e.g.,

Kung naabutan niya ang bus, hindi siya mahuhuli.
‘If he was able to catch the bus, he won’t bc late.")

A basic verb form alternates freely with a contemplated form in Aung and (kung) sakali + naj-ng
clauses of the type just illustrated. Thus, also:

Kung
makita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
(Kung) sakaling
‘If
I see him, I'll tel! him what happened.’
‘In case

A basic verb form may also follow kung (but not (kung) sakali +naj-ng) in a sentence whose main clause is
equational or includes an imperfective verbal predicate. In these cases, the main clause expresses an action
or condition characteristically associated with the action or condition expressed in the Aung clause, and the
kung clause is normally equivalent to an English ‘when’ clause. Normally the topic of the kung clause and
that of the main clause have the same referent in sentences of this type. When this referent is a human being
or pet animal, the non-initial clause either has a personal—pronoun topic or Jacks an expressed topic. When
the referent is not a human being or pet animal, the non-initial clause is topicless. Some examples are:

Kung magsalita ng Ingles si Juan, parang Amerikano (siya).
‘When Juan speaks English, he sounds like an American.’

Kung alisin sa tubig ang isdang ito, namamatay agad.
‘When this fish is taken out of the water, it dies at once.”

Matamis ang prutas na ito kung mahinog.
‘This fruit is sweet when it ripens.”

(As is noted in §3.29, subsection (7), (ka Jpag(ka) is optionally pre-enclitic, while kung is obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic. Thus:

j dinadalaw ko siya, |
(Ka)pag(ka) palagi akong nagdadala ng regalo.
| ko siya dinadalaw, \

‘When I visit him, I always bring a present.’

but only:

Kung dinadalaw ko siya, palagi akong nagdadala ng regalo.
(Same meaning)

(Kung) sakati is optionally pre-enclitic with enclitic particles, and obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with personal
pronouns.

(2) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED OR VERBLESS PREDICATES. Clauses in this class are presented
below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by haba +na/-ng, hangga’t miyentras + (optionally) na/-ng, and
samantala + naj-ng, (b) clauses introduced by noon; (c) clauses introduced by ngayon at and
ngayon + na}-ng;(d) clauses introduced by tuwi + na/-ng.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
470 CHAPTER 6

(a) Haba +na/-ng, hangga't, miyentras, and samantala + naj-ng all introduce clauses equivalent to
English ‘while’ clauses. The clause may have a verbless or an imperfective verbal predicate. Examples are:

Habang narito ako,
Haba akong narito, \

Hangga’t narito ako,

Miyentras narito ako, dapat akong tumulong.
Miyentras ako(ng) warto,}

Samantalang narito a

Samantala akong nariot,

‘While I’m here, I ought to help.’

(Haba, miyentras, and samantala are optionally pre-enclitic; hangga'’t is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic — cf.
§3.29, subsection (II.A.7).)

Habang
Hangga’t
nagtatrabaho si Juan, umaawit siya.
Miyentras
Samantalang
‘While Juan works, he sings.”

Hangga’t may also mean ‘as long as,’ as in:

Hangga’t ginagawa niya ang trabaho, wala akong tutol.
‘As long as he does the work, I have no objection.’

Miyentras, while common in ordinary conversation, is not used in formal speech or writing.
(b) Noon +-ng or na/-ng introduces clauses equivalent to English ‘when’ clauses that refer to

situations or actions that are confined to the past, and that are concurrent with the situation or action
expressed by the main clause. The noon clause may have a verbless or an imperfective verbal predicate.
Examples are:

Nakatira siya sa dormitoryo noong istudyante siya.
‘He lived in the dormitory when he was a student.”

Noon daw (na) nagtatrabaho}
siya sa pabrika, malaki ang suweldo niya.

Noong nagtatrabaho raw

‘They say that when he was working in the factory, his pay was large.’

(The same meanings may be expressed by clauses introduced by nang — see (S.c), below.)
As the last example shown, noon is optionally pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic particles (cf. §6.6,
subsection 2(b)) but obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns (cf. §3.29, subsection (1.A.10)).
(c) Ngayon at and ngayon + naj-ng are equivalent to English ‘now that.’ They introduce clauses with
a verbless predicate or with any inflected verbal predicate. Examples are:

Negayon at}
mayaman na siya, hindi na siya dumadalaw sa amin.

Ngayong |

‘Now that he’s rich, he no longer visits us.’

magsisimula
f ngayon at
Makakatulong na siya nagsisimula siya ng paggawa.

| neayong j nagsimula

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS an

{ is about to start
‘He'll soon be able to help now that he is starting to work.”
has started

(d) Tuwi + na/-ng introduces clauses equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘every time (that).’

Imperfective—aspect predicates and contemplated—aspect predicates alternate freely within fuwi + na/-ng
clauses: e.g.,

{ nakikita
Tuwing ko iyon, naaalala ko sila.
makikita
‘Every time I see that, I remember them.”
{ umaalis }
Umiiyak ang bata tuwing sa bahay ang ina.
aalis

‘The child cries every time the mother leaves the house.”

Perfective—aspect predicates do not occur within mawi + na/-ng clauses. Examples of newi + na/-ng clauses
with verbless predicates are:

Tuwing narito si Juan, nagkakaroon kami ng pagtatalo.
‘Every time Juan is here, we have an argument.”

Tuwing may pera daw siya, naglalasing (siya).
‘They say that every time he has some moncy, he gets drunk.’

(Juni is optionally pre-enclitic; thus the following also occurs (cf. the last example above):

Tuwi daw siyang may pera, naglalasing siya.
‘They say that every time he has some money, he gets drunk.’)

(3) CLAUSES WITH BASIC-FORM OR VERBLESS PREDICATES, Clauses in this class are
introduced by oras na or sa sandali + naj/-ng. The clauses are equivalent to English clauses introduced by
‘the moment (that)’ or ‘the minute (that),’ when these clauses refer to future time. Oras na connotes strong
emotion; it is used, for example, in warning or threats: ¢.g.,

Magpapakamatay ako oras na maging di-matapat sa akin ang mangingibig ko.
“I'll kill myself the moment my lover is untrue to me.’

Oras na makita ko siya, itatapon ko ito sa mukha niya.
‘The minute [ see him, I'll throw this in his face.’

Sa sandali + naj-ng lacks this connotation. Some examples are:

Magpalakpakan kayo sa sandaling iabot ko ito sa kaniya.
“‘Applaud the moment | hand this to him.’

{ sandali pong dumating siya,
Sa teteleponohan ko kayo.
| sandaling dumating po siya,

‘The minute he arrives, I'll phone you, sir/madam.”

(As the last example shows, sa sandali is optionally pre-enclitic with enclitic particles, obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic with enclitic pronouns.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
472 CHAPTER 6

(4) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Clauses in this class are
presented below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by bago; (b) clauses introduced by hanggang (sa);
(c) clauses introduced by matapos + -ng or na/-ng ang pagkatapos +-ng or na/-ng.

(a) Bago is equivalent to English ‘before.’ A bago clause with a basic—form predicate is the most
frequent equivalent of an English ‘before’ clause or of a phrase consisting of ‘before” plus the ‘-ing” form of
a verb. A basic—form predicate alternates with, but is preferred to, an imperfective—aspect predicate to
express habitual or repeated action in the present or past. In each of the following examples, the first of the
two alternative verb forms in the bago clause is preferred. (The main clause of a sentence that includes a
bago clause often includes the enclitic particle muna ‘first’ — cf. §6.4, subsection (h).)

mag-aral
Bago siya ‘ ng liksyon, nagbabasa muna (siya) ng diyaryo.
l nag-aaral
reads )
‘Before studying his lessons, he the newspaper (first).’
used to read {
mahinog
Bago ang prutas na ito, maasim.
nahihinog
‘Before this fruit ripens, it’s sour.”
{ magsimula

Dati, palaging may handaan kina Alkalde Guinto bago ang kombensyon.
nagsisimula

‘Formerly, there was always a party at Mayor Guinto’s before the convention started.’

(When, as is often the case, the topic of the bago clause and that of the main clause have the same referent,
the non-initial clause either optionally or obligatorily lacks an expressed topic: optionally when the topic
may be expressed by a personal pronoun (as in the first example above), obligatorily when it may not (as in
the second). As is noted in §3.29, subsection (II.A.7), bago is obligatorily pre-enclitic — cf. the first
example above.)

A basic—form predicate is also used to express contemplated action. If the contemplated action is
habitual, the sentence often includes an adverb such as buhat ngayon ‘from now on,” (pa)lagi ‘always,’ or
gabi-gabi ‘every night.’ Examples are:

f magsasalita ang Alkalde.
Bago magsimula ang miting,
| nandoon na kami,
the Mayor will speak.”
‘Before the meeting starts,
we will be there (already).

Buhat ngayon, lagi nilang isususi ang mga pintuan bago sila matulog.
‘From now on, they will always lock the doors before they go to bed.”

A contemplated—aspect predicate occurs in a bago clause only in sentences expressing strong requests
for future habitual action, as in:

Buhat nga ngayon, lagi mong isususi ang mga pintuan bago ka matutulog.
‘From now on, please lock the doors before you go to bed.”

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 473

(In all other contexts, the basic—form predicate is used to express future habitual action; thus, for example:

Mag-aaral siya ng liksyon niya bago siya matulog gabi-gabi.
‘He will study his lessons before he goes to bed every night.”

but never:
*Mag-aaral siya ng liksyon niya bago siya matutulog gabi-gabi.)

To express completed action, a perfective—aspect predicate is used in the bago clause, as in the
following:

Bago natulog ang mga bata, uminom sila ng gatas.
‘Before the children went to bed, they drank some milk.”

Karpintero siya bago siya nagsimulang magtrabaho dito.
“He was a carpenter before he began to work here.”

A basic—form predicate occurs in the bago clause instead of a perfective—aspect predicate where the verb is
one that normally forms a topicless phenomenal sentence (cf. §7.21) as in the following:

j mag-ala-una.
Dumating sila bago
| mag-Pasko.

one o'clock.’
‘They arrived before

Christmas.”

or where the topic of the bago clause is omitted (by reason of having the same referent as the main clause,
as noted above), as in the following:

Uminom ng gatas ang mga bata bago matulog.
‘The children drank some milk before going to bed.”

Pinitas niya ang mangga bago mahinog.
‘He picked the mango before it got ripe.”

Bago does not normally introduce clauses with an equational structure. In most cases the Tagalog
equivalent of an English ‘before’ clause that includes a form of *be’ plus a predicate nominal or adjectival is

a bago clause with a predicate maging construction (cf. §5.26): e.g.,

naging-Presidente.
Mas masaya siya bago siya
naging-bantog.

{ President.’
‘He was happier before he was/became
{ famous.’

There is no *bago siya Presidente or *bago siya bantog.

Unlike ‘before,’ bago does not occur before a nominal within an adverbial phrase. The Tagalog
equivalent of an English time phrase consisting of ‘before, plus a nominal —e.g., ‘before one o'clock,’
‘before breakfast,” ‘before evening’ — is normally expressed by bago plus a basic—form verb, as in:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
474 CHAPTER 6

mag-ala-una.
Magpasyal tayo bago mag-almusal,
gumabi.

(it’s) one o'clock.’
“Let's take a walk before (having) breakfast.’
(it’s) evening.’

(b) Hanggang and hanggang sa alternate freely in clauses equivalent to English clauses introduced by
‘until.’ A hanggang (sa) clause with basic—form predicate may occur in a sentence expressing a past,
present, or future situation or action. Examples are:

titira
Hanggang (sa) magkaroon din sila ng sariling bahay, | tumitira sila sa amin.
tumira
get will live
‘Until they get a house of their own (too), they are living with us.”
got lived
Ibibilad
Ibinibilad nila sa araw hanggang (sa) matuyo.
Ibinilad
will expose } ( dries.”
‘They expose it to the sun until it dries.’
l exposed { latiea

A perfective—aspect predicate alternates freely with a basic-form predicate within a hanggang (sa)
clause that expressed a completed action. Thus, also:

Ibinilad nila sa araw hanggang (sa) natuyo.
‘They exposed it to the sun until it dried.’

Contemplated—aspect and imperfective—aspect predicates do not occur after hanggang (sa).

Hanggang is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic (cf. §3.29, subsection (1.A.10)).

(c) As subordinating conjunctions, matapos and pagkatapos are both equivalent to English ‘after.’
(Matapos also occurs as the basic form of a verb meaning ‘finish,’ and pagkatapos as the aspectless
gerund — cf. §3.26 — related to this verb.) They are followed (when used as subordinating conjunctions) by
either the linker -ng or the linker na/-ng. (Occurring directly after matapos or pagkatapos, the linker -ng has
a zero form, the linker na/-ng the form /naf — cf. §§3.8 and 3.11. Since matapos and pagkatapos are both
optionally pre-enclitic — cf. §3.29, subsection (II.A.7) — enclitic personal pronouns and/or particles may
occur between them and the linker, in which case the linker, whether -ng or na/-ng, usually has the form
fal.)

A matapos or pagkatapos clause with a basic—form predicate is the most frequent equivalent of an
English ‘after’ clause or of a phrase consisting of ‘after’ plus the ‘-ing’ form of a verb. Examples are:

mag-aaral
Matapos
(na) linisin ng katulong ang salas nag-aaral ako roon.
Pagkatapos
nag-aral

‘After the maid cleans the living room, I study there.”

Umuuwi na siya ang mga sulat.

pagkatapos { | niyang basahin

Umuwi
will go )
‘He goes home right after reading the letters.”
l went j

If the predicate verb in a pagkatapos clause is actor—focus (cf. §2.10), the actor is expressed by ang
phrase, rather than an ang phrase. In a matapos clause with an actor—focus predicate verb, the actor is, as

usual, expressed by an ang phrase. Compare the pagkatapos and matapos clauses in the following sentences:

(na) magtalumpati siya,
Matapos
siyang magtalumpati,
kumanta kami ng ilang awit.
(na) magtalumpati niya,
Pagkatapos
niyang magtalumpati,

‘After he spoke, we sang a few songs.’

matapos (na) kumain ng hapunan ang mga bata.
Aalis kami
pagkatapos (na) kumain ng hapunan ng mga bata.
‘We'll leave after the children eat lunch.’

Contemplated—aspect and imperfective—aspect predicates do not occur after matapos and
pagkatapos. Perfective—aspect predicates are uscd to imply a contradiction between the expected

consequence of the action expressed in the subordinate clause and the actual consequence, as expressed in
the main clause: e.g.,

Matapos

ko siyang tinulungan, sinisi pa niya ako.
Pagkatapos
‘(Even) after I helped him, he still blamed me.”

Like bago (cf. (3.2), above), matapos and pagkatapos do not normally introduce clauses with an
equational structure. (The usual equivalent of an English ‘after’ clause that includes a form of ‘be’ plus a
predicate nominal or adjectival is a mang clause (cf. (S.b), below) with a predicate formed by the

corresponding Tagalog nominal or adjectival — or by a maging construction (cf. §5.17) — followed by the
enclitic na, thus:

{ biyuda \
maging biyuda

Nang na ang reyna, pambihira na siyang naglakbay.

{ matanda
maging matanda

476 CHAPTER 6

was a widow
‘After the queen » She seldom traveled.’)

became old

Again like bago, matapos does not occur before nominals within adverbial phrases. Pagkatapos,
however, occurs before ng plus a nominal in the time—gerund subclass of adverbial phrases (cf. §6.8,
subsection (3).)

(5) CLAUSES WITH VERBLESS, INFLECTED, OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Clauses in this
class are presented below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by (mag)buhat nang and (mag )mula nang;
(b) clauses introduced by nang.

(a) (Mag /buhat nang and (magjmula nang introduce clauses equivalent to English time clauses
introduced by ‘since.’ The clauses may have verbless, basic— form, or perfective—aspect predicates, the latter
two altemating freely. (Clauses with verbless predicates normally include the enclitic particle pa ‘still,
yet’ — cf. §6.2.) Some examples are:

(Mag)buhat bata
nang pa si Linda, gusto na niyang maging mang-aawit.
(Mag)mula maliit
a child
‘Since Linda was , she has wanted to become a singer.’
small

(Mag)buhat mamatay
nang

(Mag)mula namatay
‘Since his wife died, he hasn’t been able to do any work.”

ang awawa niya, hindi na siya nakagawa ng trabaho.

(Mag Jbuhat and (mag}mula are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic pronouns (cf.
§3.29, subsection (1.A.10)), but optionally non-pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic particles (cf. §6.6,
subsection (2.a)).

(b) Nang, like noon + -ng or naj-ng (cf. (2.6), above), introduces clauses equivalent to English ‘when’
clauses that refer to situations or actions confined to the past. A nang clause with a basic—form predicate
expresses an action occurring immediately before the action expressed by the main clause; the English
equivalent of the clause may often be introduced by cither ‘as soon as’ or ‘when.’ Examples are:

Nang makita ko siya, nakilala ko siya agad.
“As soon as

I saw him, I recognized him at once.”
‘When j

Natawa siya nang sabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
‘He laughed when I told him what had happened.”

A nang clause with a verbless or imperfective—aspect predicate expresses a situation or action
concurrent with that expressed in the main clause. (Nang and noon + na/-ng are interchangeable in such
cases.) Examples are:

Nang nasa unibersidad ba siya, nakatira siya sa dormitoryo?
‘When he was in the university, did he live in the dormitory?’

Nang nagtatrabaho siya sa pabrika, malaki ang suweldo niya.
‘When he was working in the factory, his pay was large.”

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 477

Contemplated—aspect and perfective—aspect predicates have their usual meanings in nang clauses:

Nang aalis na ako, tinawag niya ako,
‘When I was about to leave, he called me.”

Nasa Maynila sila nang nagsimula ang World War II.
‘They were in Manila when World War II began.”

§6.16. Cause, result, and purpose clauses.

The equivalent of an English clause introduced by ‘because’ is expressed by a Tagalog clause
introduced by one of the following subordinating conjunctions: dahil (sa), dahilan sa, gawa ng, porke,
(sa)pagka't. Dahil (sa), dahilan sa, and gawa ng are common in both formal and informal contexts. Porke is
used only in informal contexts, and expresses an ironic or critical attitude (often expressible in English by
‘just because’). (Sa/pagka't is more common in formal than in informal contexts. Subordinate clauses
expressing cause (and those expressing result — see below) may have verbless or inflected predicates, but
not basic—form predicates. Some examples are:

Dahil (sa)

Dahilan sa nahuli ako, hindi ko narinig ang takdang aralin.
Gawa ng

‘Because | was late, I didn’t hear the assignment.”

dahil (sa)
Hindi siya makakadalo sa pulong dahilan sa marami siyang gawain.

| gawa ng
‘He won’t be able to go to the meeting because he has a lot to do.”

{ tumanggap siya )
Porke ng mabuting marka, hindi na siya nakikipag-usap sa atin.

siya tumanggap f
‘Just because he got a good grade, he no longer speaks to us.”

(Sa)pagka’t mataba ang lupa, umunlad ang mga dayuhan.
“Because the land was rich, the immigrants prospered.”

(Porke is optionally pre-enclitic; the other subordinating conjunctions are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.)
The equivalent of an English clause introduced by ‘since’ (in the meaning ‘as a result of the fact that’)
is expressed in Tagalog by a clause introduced by /ya)yaman plus the linker na/-ng. Examples are:

(Ya)yaman daw na umuulan, ipapapagpaliban ang laro.
‘They say that since it’s raining, the game will be postponed.”

Mag-aaral ako bukas (ya)yamang walang panahon ngayon.
‘T'll study tomorrow since there’s no time today.”

The subordinating conjunction kaya introduces clauses that express the result of the action expressed
by the main clause. When the kaya clause follows the main clause, it is often translatable by an English
clause introduced by ‘with the result that’ or ‘so’: e.g.,

Tinukso ni Juan ang bata, kaya umiyak.
‘Juan teased the child, with the result that it cried.’

May tipan ako nang alas dos, kaya dapat akong umalis.
‘L have an appointment at two o‘clock, so I have to leave.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
478 CHAPTER 6

When the kaya clause is sentence—initial, it is often translatable by an English clause introduced by ‘the
reason (that),’ with ‘is/was that” preceding the equivalent of the non-initial clause. The non-initial clause
may optionally be preceded by dahil (sa), without change of meaning. Examples are:

Kaya umiyak ang bata, (dahil (sa)) tinukso ni Juan.
‘The reason that the child cried was that Juan teased her.’

Kaya dapat akong umalis, (dahil (sa)) may tipan ako nang alas dos.
‘The reason I have to leave is that I have an appointment at two o'clock.’

Clauses expressing purpose (equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘(in order) to,’ ‘in order that,’
‘so that’) are introduced by para, or upang. Para may be used in cither informal or formal contexts, upang
only in formal contexts. Only basic--form verbal predicates occur in purpose clauses. Some examples are:

para

Matulog na tayo makaalis tayo nang maaga bukas.
upang

‘Let's go to bed now so that we can leave early tomorrow.”

Para )
hindi magutom ang mga bata, nagdala kami ng tinapay.

Upang

‘In order that the children would not get hungry, we took along some bread.’

para
Nagpunta siya sa bayan bumili ng mga kasangkapan.

upang
‘He went to town to buy some tools.”

(In some cases, purpose may also be expressed by a clause introduced by the coordinating conjunction at
nang — cf. §7.19, subsection (7).)

§6.17. Concessive clauses.

Tagalog concessive clauses (equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘(al)though,’ ‘even though,”
‘even if, ‘in spite of the fact that,” etc.) may be introduced by one of a variety of subordinating
conjunctions. A concessive meaning may also be expressed by the use of certain enclitic particles.
Concessive clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions are divisible into three classes on the basis of
the types of verbal predicates that may occur within them:

(1) Clauses with inflected predicates (clauses introduced by bagaman (at), bagama’t, ganoong,
gayong)

(2) Clauses with basic-form predicates (clauses introduced by (ka)sukdulan +na/-ng,
matuluyan + naj/-ng, sukdan + na/-ng, huwag (na} (hin }di)

(3) Clauses with either inflected or basic—form predicates (clauses introduced by kahit (na), maski

(na})

(Nominal or adjectival predicates may occur in clauses of classes (1) and (3). In clauses of class (2), nominal
or adjectival predicates may occur after huwag (na) (hin di.) Concessive clauses involving enclitic particles
constitute two additional classes:

(4) Man clauses
(5) na... paandpa... na clauses

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 479

The classes are presented below in the order listed.
(1) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED PREDICATES. Bagaman (at) and bagama't are equivalent to
English ‘(al)though.’ Examples are:

mag-aaral,
Bagaman (at) }
hindi sila nag-aaral, umaasa silang pumasa.
Bagama’t {
nag-aral,
{ aren’t going to
‘Although they don’t study, they expect to pass.”
| aian'
{ bagaman (at)
Nagmamaneho siya ng kotse wala sa hustong gulang.
bagama’t

‘He drives a car though he’s not of age.’

Ganoong and gayong are equivalent to English ‘in spite of the fact that’ or ‘even though.’ Their use
implies criticism or disapproval of the action or situation expressed in the main clause. Examples are:

Ganoong |
may sakit siya, nagpipilit na pumarito.
Gayong \
‘In spite of the fact that he’s sick, he insists on coming.”
babayaran
{ ganoong
Hindi raw nila gagawin ang trabaho binabayaran mo sila.
| savone
binayaran
( are going to pay
‘They say they won't do the work even though you are paying them.’
paid

Bagaman is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns, optionally pre-enclitic with respect
to enclitic particles; the other conjunctions are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.

(2) CLAUSES WITH BASIC- FORM PREDICATES, (Ka)sukdulan + naj-ng, matuluyan + na/-ng, and
sukdan + naf-ng introduce clauses that express a hypothetical future action or situation; they are equivalent
to English ‘even though’ or ‘even if.’ Examples are:

(ka)sukdulang

Hindi ko ibibigay ito sa kaniya matuluyang pagbantaan niya ako.
sukdang j

‘I won’t give this to him even if he should threaten me.”

(Ka)sukdulan

Matuluyan siyang magalit, ipapasuri nila siya sa doktor.
Sukdan

‘Even though he may get angry, they’ll have the doctor examine him.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
480 CHAPTER 6

The notation huwag (na) (hindi represents any of the following: huwag na hindi, huwag na di,
huwag hindi, huwag di. These subordinating conjunctions are equivalent to English ‘however little,” ‘even
if... just ...a little.” Examples are:

Huwag (na) (hin)di ako kumain, tumataba ako.
‘However little I cat, I still get fat.’

Umiiyak ang bata huwag (na) (hin)di mo tuksuhin.
‘The child cries even if you just tease it a little.’

(Huwag (na) is non-pre-enclitic; (hin di is obligatorily pre-enclitic.)

(3) CLAUSES WITH EITHER INFLECTED OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Before an inflected
predicate, kahit (na) and maski (na) are similar in meaning to ganoong and gayong (cf. (1), above), except
that their use does not necessarily imply criticism or disapproval of the action expressed in the main clause.

babayaran
Kahit )
(na) binabayaran mo sila, hindi mo maipapagawa iyon sa kanila.
Maski {
binayaran
{ are going to pay
‘Even though you are paying them, you can’t ask them to do that.”
l paid
magagalit
{ kahit
Kakausapin ko rin siya (na) nagagalit sa akin.
l maski
nagalit
will get }
‘Tl talk to him anyway, even though he is getting angry with me.”
got j

Before a basic—form predicate, kahit (na) and maski (na) are similar in meaning to kasukdulan + naj-ng, etc.
(cf. (2), above). Examples are:

Kahit

(na) pagbantaan din niya ako, hindi ko ibibigay ito sa kaniya.
Maski
‘Even if he should threaten me too, I won’t give this to him.’

{ kahit
Hindi mababasag ito (na) ibagsak mo.
(maa)

‘This won’t break even if you should drop it.”

(Maski is optionally pre-enclitic; thus, also: maski niya ako pagbantaan; maski mo ibagsak. The na that
frequently follows maski is an enclitic particle (cf. §6.3). If both na and other enclitics follow maski, their
order follows the rules given in §6.2. Thus: maski na niya ako pagbantaan; maski mo na ibagsak.

(4) Man CLAUSES. The enclitic particle nian occurs in a concessive clause equivalent to an English
clause introduced by ‘even if or ‘even though’ (cf. §6.4, subsection (a.2)). (The main clause optionally but
commonly includes the enclitic particle dinfrin.) Like kahit (na) and maski (na) clauses (cf. (3), above),

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 481

man clauses with basic-form predicates express a hypothetical future situation or action, while those with

imperfective, perfective, or verbless predicates express an actual situation or action. Man is not used in
concessive clauses with predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect. Some examples are:

Sabihin ko man ang totoo, hindi ka rin maniniwala sa akin.
“Even if I tell the truth, you still won't believe me.’

{ nagagalit )

man siya sa akin.
| nagalit j

Kakausapin ko pa rin siya

{ is getting
‘Til talk to him anyway, even though he angry with me.”

l got

Mahal man ang sapatos, binili ko rin.
‘Even though the shoes were expensive, I bought them anyway.”

(5) Na... pa and pa... na clauses. Occurring in successive clauses, the enclitic particles na and pa,
or pa and na, indicate incompatibility between the actions, conditions, etc., expressed by the clauses. The
clauses may have verbless or inflected predicates. In some cases it is the na clause that is equivalent to an
English clause introduced by ‘(al)though’ or ‘even though’; in other cases it is the pa clause. (A more
detailed explanation is given in §6.3, subsection (7).) Some examples are:

Dumarating na ang mga bisita, maglilinis ka pa ng bahay.
‘Even though the guests are already arriving, you're going to clean house.”

Umalis na si Juan sa mesa, kumakain pa ang mga iba.
‘Juan left the table, even though the others were still eating.’

Mainit na mainit pa ang kape, ininom na niya.
‘Although the coffee was still very hot, he drank it anyway.”

Isinuot pa niya ang damit, luma na.
‘She wore the dress though it was already worn out.”

(The English equivalents of sentences with na... pa or pa... na clauscs may often involve ‘and’ or ‘but.’
Thus the first of the above examples may also be translated ‘The guests are already arriving, and you're
going to clean house!’ and the third may be translated ‘The coffee was still very hot, but he drank it
anyway.’)

§6.18. Other adverbial clauses.

Subordinating conjunctions not presented in §§6.15 through 6.17 are presented below as
follows: (1) bukod sa; (2) dangan at, danga’t; (3) imbis + na/-ng, (sa) halip + na/-ng, (sa) lugar + naj-ng; (4)
maliban kung.

(1) Bukod sa is equivalent to English ‘besides (the fact that).’ A bukod sa clause may have a verbless
or an inflected predicate. Some examples are:

Nag-aalaga siya ng hayop, bukod sa nagtatrabaho siya sa bukid.
‘He raises animals, besides working in the field.”

darating

Bukod sa dumarating na sila, marami pa akong ibang problema.
dumating

482 CHAPTER 6°

have already arrived,

‘Besides the fact that they

Bukod is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns, but optionally non-pre-enclitic with
respect to enclitic particles.

(2) Dangan at and its contracted form danga’t are equivalent to English ‘were it not (for the fact)
that.’ A dangan at (or danga’t) clause may have a verbless or an inflected predicate; the clause frequently
includes the enclitic particles nga /a/mang. The main clause normally includes the enclitic particle sana (cf.
§6.5, subsection (e)). Examples are:

dangan (nga la(ma)ng) at malayo )

Bibilhin ko sana ang bahay, sa siyudad.

danga’t malayo (nga la(ma)ng) j
‘I would buy the house, were it not for the fact that it’s far from the city.”

aalis
Dangan at
umaalis na ang mga bisita, gagawa pa sana ako ng kape.
Danga’t
umalis
are leaving soon, )
‘Were it not for the fact that the guests are already leaving, I'd make some
have already left, f more coffee.”

(3) Imbis + naf-ng, (sa) halip + naj-ng and (sa) lugar + na/-ng are equivalent to English ‘instead of.’
The clauses they introduce have basic~form predicates. Jmbis, halip, and lugar are optionally pre-enclitic.

Examples are:

Imbis
na mag-aral siya,

(Sa) halip naglalalaro ng besbol.
siyang mag-aral,

(Sa) lugar

‘Instead of studying, he’s playing baseball.’
imbis )

Umalis sila sa halip na tumulong sa amin.
(sa) lugar

‘They left instead of helping us.’

(4) Maliban kung is equivalent to English ‘unless’ or ‘except when.’ A maliban kung clause may have
a verbless, basic-form, or inflected predicate. A basic—form predicate alternates frecly with a
contemplated—aspect predicate to express a future possibility: ¢.g.,

samahan

Hindi ako pupunta roon maliban kung mo ako.
sasamahan

‘L won’t go there unless you go with me.”

Examples of imperfective, perfective, and verbless predicates are:

Maliban kung kumakain siya, lagi siyang nakatabako,
‘Except when he is eating, he is always smoking a cigar.’

Darating si Linda mamaya, maliban kung hindi siya pinayagan.
‘Linda will be coming later, unless she wasn’t given permission.’

Maliban kung may pera si Rosa, hindi tayo makakapasok sa sine.
‘Unless Rosa has some money, we won’t be able to go to the movies.”

Maliban is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns but optionally non-pre-enclitic with
respect to enclitic particles; Ang is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.

Derived and Minor Sentence Structures

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 485

§7.1. Introduction.

Many types of DERIVED CONSTRUCTIONS (i.e., constructions that do not themselves occur in
basic sentences, but that are related to constructions that do so occur) have been presented in Chapters 3
through 6. The derived constructions presented in these chapters are those that are best understood in
relation to a particular class of basic—sentence components: nominals, adjectivals, verbals, or adverbials (cf.
§3.1). In addition to derived constructions of these types, Tagalog has a number of derived constructions
that are equally related to two or more classes of basic—sentence components. These derived constructions
are discussed in the present chapter. Also discussed in this chapter are MINOR SENTENCE
STRUCTURES: i.e., sentence structures that lack, and fail to reflect, the predicate—plus—topic structure
of basic sentences.

The present chapter is arranged as follows. §7.2 deals with inversion constructions, § §7.3 through
7.12 with questions, and §§7.13 through 7.16 with negation. The remaining sections deal with: the
definitized predicate (7.17), indefinite forms and constructions (7.18), coordination (7.19), explanatory at
clauses (7.20), topicless phenomenal sentences (7.21), social formulas (7.22), and interjections (7.23).

§7.2. Inversion constructions..

An INVERSION CONSTRUCTION is a construction characterized by the shifting to sentence—initial
or clause—initial position of some sentence component that does not occur in this position in basic
sentences. Inversion constructions may involve the placement of a topic before a predicate, the placement
of an adverbial before a predicate, the placement of a verb complement before a predicate verb, the
placement of a phrase introduced by ni or ni... ni before the negator wala (cf. §7.14), or one of certain
combinations of these. The inversion constructions that occur in Tagalog are dealt with below under the
following headings: (1) AY INVERSION; (2) CONTRASTIVE INVERSION; (3) EMPHATIC INVERSION;
(4) NON-EMPHATIC INVERSION.

(1) AY INVERSION. Of the four classes of inversion constructions, ay inversion permits the widest
range of sentence—component types to be shifted to initial position. The initial component in an
ay-inversion construction may be: (a) the topic; (b) an adverbial; (c)a verb complement; (d) a phrase
introduced by ni or ni... ni. The inversion—marking particle ay in most cases immediately follows the
initial topic, adverbial, etc. As is noted in §6.6, however, certain enclitic particles, if they occur in the
sentence, either obligatorily or optionally precede ay. Ay may also be immediately preceded by a pause.
This pause, which is represented in the writing system by a comma, is optional in all cases.

Ay has two forms: a full form, /’ay/, written ay in conventional spelling, and a contracted form, /y/,
written 'y in conventional spelling. The full form may occur in any context; the contracted form occurs as a
variant of the full form if the preceding word, in its independent occurrences, ends in /’/, /h/, /n/, or /w/,
and if this word is not followed by a pause. When the contracted form is used, it replaces a final /’/, /h/, or
/nf, and either replaces or follows a final /w/. Thus, bata /ba‘ta’/ ‘child’ plus 'y is /ba‘tay/, ama f’amah/
‘father’ plus 'y is /’amay/, pinsan /pinsan] ‘cousin’ plus ’y is /pinsay/, and ikaw /"ikaw/ ‘you’ plus 'y is either
likay/ or fikawy/. The contracted form of ay is more commonly used than the full form in the case of
words that, in their independent occurrences, end in /*/ or /h/. In the case of words that end in /n/ in their
independent occurrences, the contracted and full forms of ay are equally common if the word is of native
Tagalog origin: thus, either pinsan ay or pinsa’y. If the word is a loan—word from English or Spanish,
however, the full form is in most cases preferred: thus, Helen ay, rather than Hele’y, and Juan ay, rather
than Jua’y. In the case of words that end in /w/ in their independent occurrences, the contracted and full
forms are equally common in all cases. Whether or not the /w/ is retained in pronunciation, it is always
retained in conventional writing: thus ikaw'y (never *ika'y).

A sentence involving ay inversion does not differ in denotative meaning from the related sentence
without inversion. There is usually, however, a difference in stylistic level, or level of usage, between the
two sentences. Ay inversion is characteristic of formal style, and is more common in writing, lectures,
sermons, etc., than it is in ordinary conversation. In the examples of ay inversion given below, the notation
“(formal style)” is usually placed after the translations of the sentences. (But see (1.a.3), etc., following.
486 CHAPTER 7

Some examples of ay- inversion constructions involving the placement of the sentence topic in initial
position are:

Ang mga anak ay kayamanan ng mga magulang.
‘Children are the parents’ jewels.” (formal style)

(cf. Kayamanan ng mga magulang ang mga anak.
‘Children are the parents’ jewels.’)

Kayo’y mabait na mabait.
“You are very kind.’ (formal style)

(cf. Mabait na mabait kayo.
‘You are very kind.’)

Ang sulat ay tinanggap ko kahapon.
‘I received the letter yesterday.’ (formal style)

(cf. Tinanggap ko ang sulat kahapon.
‘I received the letter yesterday.”)

(a) The following features of constructions involving ay inversion of the topic may be noted:
(a.1) When the inverted topic is the second—person—singular pronoun, the form ikaw replaces the

usual topic form ka (cf. §3.3). Thus:

Ikaw ay nakita nila roon.
‘They saw you there.’ (formal style)

(cf. Nakita ka nila roon.
‘They saw you there.’)

Similarly, ikaw... ko replaces the composite pronoun Kita (which, as is noted in §3.3, is itself a
replacement of the non-occurring sequence “ko ka.) Thus:

Ikaw ay nakita ko roon.
‘I saw you there.’ (formal style)

(cf. Nakita kita roon.
‘I saw you there.’)

(a.2) Inay inversion the topic marker ang is optionally delectable before the limiters bawa’t ‘each’ and
lahat ‘all’ (cf. §3.22). Thus:

Ang bawa’t

bata’y may desk.
Bawa’t

(cf. Narito na ang lahat ng tao.

(a.3) In the case of certain sentence types where nominal—clause predicates occur opposite
nominalized—verbal topics (cf. §3.24) or opposite nominalized pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb—phrase
topics (cf. §4.21), either ay inversion or contrastive inversion of topic and predicate is obligatory. An
example of ay inversion involving a nominalized—verbal topic is:

Ang narinig ko’y darating siya bukas.
“What I heard is that he’s coming tomorrow.”

Examples involving nominalized pseudo—verb and psuedo—verb—phrase topics are:

dapat
Ang ay tumira sila dito.
nais ko
is fitting
‘What is for them to live here.’
I wish

(There is no *Darating siya bukas ang narinig ko, *Tumira sila dito ang dapat, or *Tumira sila dito ang nais
ko.)

The usual formal connotation of ay inversion does not necessarily obtain in such cases. Similarly,
when contrastive inversion — cf. (2), below — is used in such cases, the usual contrastive connotation of the
construction may be absent.

(a.4) As is noted in §4.12, an ang—phrase topic is normally replaced by a ng phrase in sentences with
ptedicate adjectives that include the intensive prefix napaka-: thus, Napakatamad ng bata ‘The child is very
lazy,’ not *Napakatamad ang bata. If, however, the order of predicate and topic is reversed in ay inversion,
the topic is expressed by an ang phrase: thus,

Ang bata’y napakatamad.
‘The child is very lazy.’ (formal style)

(a.5) In a construction involving a pscudo—verb or pscudo—verb phrase plus a linker plus a clause (ef.
$4.21), the inverted topic of the clause may occur either before or after the pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb
phrase. Examples are:

(b) Most movable adverbs (cf. §§6.7 through 6.11), and any adverbial clause (§ §6.14 through
6.18), may occur in initial position in ay inversion. Some examples involving movable adverbs are:

Noong Lunes
Doon ay ipinagbili niya ang kalabaw niya.
Dahil doon

last Monday.”
‘He sold his carabaw there.’ (formal style)
because of that.’

noong Lunes.
(cf. Ipinagbili niya ang kalabaw niya doon.

dahil doon.

last Monday.”
“He sold his carabaw there.’
because of that.”

The movable adverbs that do not undergo ay inversion are: frequency adverbs formed with beses or
ulit (cf. §6.8, subsection (1.)); palagi ‘always’ (cf. §6.8, subsection (1.g)), point—time adverbs that consist
of nang and the name of a part of the day (e.g., wnaga ‘morning’, gabi ‘night’ — cf. §6.8, subsection (1.a)); |
referential adverbs (cf. §6.11, subsection (1.c)); and manner adverbs (cf. §6.10). The following, for
example, do not occur.

beses |
*Dalawang ay pumarito siya. |
ulit I
beses.
(cf. Pumarito siya nang dalawang
ulit.
‘He came here twice.’)
*Palagi ay namimili sila dito.

(cf. Namimili sila ditong palagi.) M
‘They always go shopping here.’)

*Gabi ay aalis siya.
(cf. Aalis siya nang gabi.
“He will leave at night.’)
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 489

*Tungkol sa giyera ay nagkwento siya.
(cf. Nagkwento siya tungkol sa giyera.
‘He told a story about the war.’)

*Paismid ay nilunok niya ang pildoras.
(cf. Nilunok niya ang pildoras nang paismid.
‘He swallowed the pill with a grimace.’)

As is noted in §6.7, adverbs that in non-initial position are introduced by the linker na/-ng or the
marker nang lose this introductory element when they occur initially, thus:

Madalas ay pumupunta siya dito.
‘He comes here often.’ (formal style)

dito nang’
(cf. Pumupunta siya madalas,
ditong
‘He comes here often.”)

(This loss of introductory na/-ng or nang before inverted adverbials obtains in the case of all inversion
constructions, and is not commented on separately in subsections (2), (3), and (4) below.)
Examples of ay inversion of adverbial clauses are:

Pagdating ko sa Pilipinas ay nagpunta ako sa Baguio.
“I went to Baguio on arriving in the Philippines.’
(formal style)

(cf. Nagpunta ako sa Baguio pagdating ko sa Pilipinas.
‘I went to Baguio on arriving in the Philippines.)

Kung mabuti ang ani’y makakabili ako ng traktor.
‘T'll be able to buy a tractor if the harvest is good.”

(formal style)

(cf. Makakabili ako ng traktor kung mabuti ang ani.
‘Pil be able to buy a tractor if the harvest is good.”)

(In addition to movable adverbs and adverbial clauses, Tagalog has certain adverbs that occur only in
sentence—initial or clause—initial position, and that must be followed either by ay or by pause (cf. §6.12,
subsection (2)). The usual formal connotation of ay- inversion constructions does not necessarily obtain in
cases where ay follows one of these adverbs. An example is:

Alalaong baga’y hindi niya magagawa iyon.
‘In other words, he can’t do it.’

(There is no *Hindi niya magagawa iyon alalaong baga.))
It is possible, although not very usual, for a single sentence or clause to show ay inversion of both an
adverb and a topic. In this case, the sentence or clause includes two inversion markers. The adverb and the

topic may occur in either order: e.g.,

Kami’y bukas ay pupunta.
Bukas ay kami’y pupunta.
‘We'll go tomorrow.’ (formal style)

(cf. Pupunta kami bukas.
‘We'll go tomorrow.’)

and the sentences:

Bumili ng kotse si Manuel/Ben.
‘Manuel/Ben bought a car.”

Binili ni Manuel/Ben ang kotse.
‘Manuel/Ben bought the car.’

If the basic form in the adjunct is AF, and the topic of the A verb is not an enclitic
pronoun, the topic may occur either before the linker or after the basic form or its
complement(s). Thus, also:

Natuksong bumili ng kotse si Manuel/Ben.
‘Manuel/Ben was tempted to buy a car,’

If the basic form in the adjunct is GF, or if the basic form is AF and the topic is an
enclitic pronoun, the topic always precedes the linker.

(Constructions involving na/-ng plus an adjunct that includes a basic form are often
similar in shape to constructions involving nominalized basic forms (cf. §3.25) or
imperative nominal clauses. In the case of nominalized basic forms, the introductory
linker is usually -ng rather than na/-ng, and the basic—form construction occurs as an
expansion of a nominal; often there is also alternation betwcen the linker and the topic
marker ang. For a discussion of imperative nominal clauses, cf. §3.28, subsection (2).)

In the presentation that follows, it is to be understood, unless otherwise specified, that

The adjunct introduced by na/-ng includes an inflected form of a verb. (The bases that
form most of the verbs in this class also occur in maka-/ma- object verbs of related
meaning — cf. §5.3, class B.1. No exact maka- verb counterpart, however, occurs for the
ma- verbs followed by adjuncts.)
IV. TRANSITIVE VERBS THAT ACCEPT ADJUNCTS. There are at least five transitive verbs that
accept adjuncts in addition to their regular complements. Four of these are object verbs meaning
‘invite’: viz., kumumbida/kumbidahin, mag-anyaya/anyayahan, mag-imbitafimbitahin, yumayafyaya-
in. The fifth is the directional verb sumabay/sabayan ‘do togwther with.”

The adjuncts that occur with verbs meaning ‘invite’ are introduced by the linker na/-ng and
include the basic form of a verb (cf. discussion under HU, above, for details of the formation of

basic—form adjuncts). Examples are:

kumumbida

nag-anyaya } tumikim nito.
Ako ang sa dalagang

nag-imbita tikman ito.

yumaya

‘It was I who invited the girl to taste this.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
396 CHAPTER S$

Kinumbida

Inanyayahan j tumikim nito.
ko ang dalagang

Inimbita | tikman ito.

Niyaya

‘L invited the girl to taste this.”

The AF verbs in this group accept adjuncts only where they occur in nominalized position (cf.
§3.24), and only when their object complements are expressed by sa phrases. Thus, while there are
sentences like:

Kumumbida ako ng dalaga.
‘Linvited a girl.”

and

Ako ang kumumbida ng dalaga.
‘It was I who invited a girl.”

there is no:

*Kumumbida ako ng/sa dalagang tumikim nito.

or:
*Ako ang kumumbida ng dalagang tumikim nito.

Adjuncts that occur with sumabay/sabayan are of the shape ng plus a gerund or a nominalized
verb base. Examples are:

Sumabay ako sa kanila pagkain.
ng

Sinabayan ko sila kain.

‘Late together with them."

§5.27. Maging constructions.

AMAGING CONSTRUCTION consists of a form of the verb maging /magin/ plus an unmarked noun,
an adjective, or an expansion of an unmarked noun or adjective. MAGING CONSTRUCTIONS are usually
translatable by ‘become’ constructions in English.

Maging is similar to the verbal prefixes in being obligatorily non-pre-enclitic (i.¢., it is never
immediately followed by an enclitic particle or pronoun — cf. § §3.29 and 6.6), and is sometimes written as
a prefix in conventional spelling. Thus the Tagalog equivalent of, for example, ‘become president’ is
sometime spelled maging-presidente, sometimes maging presidente. Analytically, it seems on the whole
preferable to regard maging as an independent verb rather than as a prefix, in view of the fact that it may
occur as one of the two components of a construction whose other component is not a base, but, rather, an
expanded construction: e.g.,

maging unang presidente ng samahan
‘become the first president of the organization’

maging pinakamabuting presidente sa Jahat
‘become the best president of all’
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 397

Maging is actor—focus, and is inflected for aspect like other actor—focus verbs: i.e., it occurs in a
recent—perfective form (cf. §5.23), as well as in forms marked for the three basic aspects. The
aspect—marked forms of maging are:

contemplated: magiging {magi'gin/
imperfective: nagiging /nagi-gin/
perfective: nagiging /nagi*gin/
recent—perfective: kapagiging /kapagi-gin/

Examples in sentences are:

Magiging
Nagiging mayamang-mayaman sila.
Naging

will become )

‘They | are becoming very rich.”
became {

Kapagiging sarhento pa lang ng anak ko.
‘My son has just become a sergeant.”

Maging has a pluralized form, mangagiging, marked by the infix -nga- (cf. §5.15):

Nangagiging mahal ang mga kamatis.
‘Tomatoes are becoming expensive.’

There are also two gerunds (cf. §3.26) that correspond to maging: the aspectless gerund pagiging /pagi-gin/
and the perfective gerund pag(ka )kapaging /pag(ka)ka‘ pagin/:

Pagiging
Ikinatuwa ko ang presidente niya.
pag(ka)kapaging
{ becoming )
‘His president made me happy.”
| having become|

Finally, there is a causative—focus verb derived from maging: ifka}paging /i(ka)pagin/. (For some speakers

ipaging is the preferred form; for others ipaging and ikapaging are free alternants.) An example of the use of
the causative—focus verb is:

Ipinaging/Ikinapaging mahal ng bigas ang nakaraang bagyo.
‘The recent typhoon caused rice to become expensive.”

(cf. Naging mahal ang bigas dahil sa nakaraang bagyo.
‘Rice became expensive because of the recent typhoon.”)

(As is the case with other causative—focus verbs (cf. §5.8), i(ka)paging takes an actor complement that
corresponds to the topic of the related actor—focus verb.)

398 CHAPTER $

§5.28. Intensive—repetitive verbal constructions.

Any verb, whether major or derived, that expresses an action capable of intensive, repeated, or
prolonged performance, may occur in an INTENSIVE- REPETITIVE CONSTRUCTION expressing such a
performance of the action. The construction consists of two occurrences of the verb linked by the particle
nang {nan/. Both structurally and semantically, the construction is similar to the English construction in
which two occurrences of a verb are linked by ‘and’. Thus:

Tumawa nang tumawa si Juan.
‘Juan laughed and laughed.”

Siya ang sinulatan nang sinulatan ni Pedro.
‘She’s the one that Pedro writes and writes to.’

Papagtatrabahuhin nang papagtatrabahuhin ni Miss Reyes ang mga bata.
‘Miss Reyes will make the children work and work.’

The construction may also be translated by an English construction of the shape ‘keep —_ing,’ or by a vetb
followed by an expression such as ‘a lot,’ ‘continually,’ repeatedly,’ etc.

The verbs that may occur in an intensive—repetitive construction include the various intensive verb
formations presented in §5.16, subsection (1). Some examples are:

Nag-iiyak nang nag-iiyak ang babae.
‘The woman kept weeping bitterly.’

(cf. Nag-iiyak ang babae.
‘The woman wept bitterly.’)

Pinagsusuntok nang pinagsusuntok ng mga bantay ang bilanggo.
‘The guards kept punching and punching the prisoner.”

(cf. Pinagsusuntok ng mga bantay ang bilanggo.
‘The guards kept punching the prisoner.’ )

Any enclitic pronoun(s) and/or particle(s) (cf. §§3.29 and 6.2 ff.) present in a sentence with an
intensive—repetitive construction in predicate position occur between the first verb and the particle nang.
Thus:

Tumakbo siya nang tumakbo.
‘He ran and ran.”

Nag-aaral daw naman nang nag-aaral si Joe.
‘They say that Joe, on the other hand, studies and studies.”

In the case of intensive—repetitive construction with imperfective—aspect actor—focus verbs, the
verbal affixes and aspect markers are often optionally deletable. The resultant contracted construction,
which has the shape base + nang + base, is identical in meaning with the full intensive—repetitive
construction from which it is derived. Examples are:

Lakad nang lakad ang kartero.
‘The postman walks and walks.’

(cf. Lumalakad nang lumalakad ang kartero.
‘The postman walks and walks.’)

iS
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 399

Luto lamang nang luto si Rosa.
‘Rosa just cooks and cooks.’

(cf. Nagluluto lamang nang nagluluto si Rosa,
‘Rosa just cooks and cooks.’)

Verb bases that may occur in this contracted intensive—repetitive construction include most -wm- and mag-
verb bases that themselves have an ‘action’ meaning (e.g., lakad ‘walk’ and luto ‘cook’ in the examples
above), and a limited number of -um-, mag-, and mang- verb bases that do not themselves have an action
meaning (e.g., haba ‘length, the base of humaba ‘become long(er), lengthen’; bago ‘new,’ the base of
magbago ‘change’; anak ‘child, the base of manganak ‘give birth.”)

Certain actor—focus indirect—action verbs (cf. §5.12, subsection (1)) occurring in an intensive—repet-
itive construction may also undergo contraction, In this case, the indirect—action prefix pa- is retained
together with the verb base, so that the construction has the shape: pa- + base + nang + pa- + base.
Examples are:

Palinis nang palinis ng bahay sa akin ang Nanay.
‘Mother makes me clean and clean the house.”

(cf. Nagpapalinis nang nagpapalinis ng bahay sa akin ang Nanay.”
‘Mother makes me clean and clean the house.")

Pakain sila nang pakain ng kendi sa kanila.
‘They let them eat and eat candy.”

(cf. Nagpapakain sila nang nagpapakain ng kendi sa kanila.
‘They let them eat and eat candy.”)

§5.29. Possessive and existential verbal construction.

Possessive and existential verbal constructions are similar in both form and meaning to possessive and
existential adjectival phrases of the shape may plus nominal or mayroon plus linker (-ng) plus nominal. (The
may and mayroon constructions occur as alternants in most contexts — cf. §§4.22 and 4.23.) The formal
differences between the adjectival and verbal structures may be described as follows:

(1) If the adjectival phrase is of the shape may plus nominal, the corresponding verbal construction
shows, in place of may, and aspect—marked form of the verbal prefix magka- /magka/. (Verbs formed with
magka- are inflected for aspect like other verbs formed with prefixes beginning with /m/— cf. §5.22.)
Compare, for example:

May pera si Juan.
‘Juan has/had some money.”

May giyera sa Europa.
‘There is/was a war in Europe.”

and, respectively:

Magkakapera )
Nagkakapera | si Juan.

Nagkapera

‘Juan is coming to have some money.’

400 CHAPTER 5

Magkakagyera )
Nagkakagyera ; sa Europa.
Nagkagyera j

{ will be )
‘There is a war (developing) in Europe.’
[me |

(2) If the adjectival phrase is of the shape mayrvon plus -ng plus nominal, the corresponding verbal
construction shows: (a) in place of the may of mayroon, an aspect—marked form of magka-;(b) in place of
-ng, the marker ng /nan/. Compare, for example:

Mayroong pera si Juan.
Mayroong giyera sa Europa.

and, respectively:

Magkakaroon )
Nagkakaroon ng pera si Juan.
Nagkaroon {

Magkakaroon
Nagkakaroon ng giyera sa Europa.
Nagkaroon

(Translations are the same as for the corresponding sentences given under (1), above.)

Apart from the replacement of may by a form of magka- and of the linker -ng by the marker ng, there
are no other formal differences between the adjectival and verbal constructions, Thus, sentences with
possessive verbal predicates, like those with possessive adjectival predicates, have the usual
predicate—plus—topic structure, while sentences with existential verbal predicates, like those with
existential adjectival predicates are topicless.

The differences in meaning between the adjectival and verbal structures are: (1) the adjectival
structures are unspecific with respect to aspect, while the verbal structures are specific; (2) the adjectival
Structures express a state (of ‘possession’ or ‘existence’), while the verbal structures express the
development of such a state. (The English equivalents of sentences with possessive verbal predicates often
involve a form of ‘come to have,’ ‘acquire,’ or ‘get’; the English equivalents of sentences with existential
verbal predicates often involve ‘there is, ctc .... developing,’ ‘there is, etc . . . getting started,” or a form of
‘occur’.)

In some cases there are verbal constructions formally related to possessive or existential phrases with
mayroon but no corresponding constructions formally related to phrases with may. While, for example,
there are verbal constructions related to phrases of the shape mayroon plus linker plus modified noun, there
are none related to phrases of the shape may plus modified noun. Thus there are sentences like:

Magkakaroon ng perang Amerikano si Juan.
‘Juan will come to have some American money.”

(cf. Mayroong perang Amerikano si Juan.
‘Juan has had some American money.’)

but there is no:

*Magkakaperang Amerikano si Juan.
(cf. May perang Amerikano si Juan.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS

401

And, while there are, in general, verbal constructions related to all existential phrases with mayroon, verbal
constructions related to existential phrases with may are limited to those cases in which the noun that
follows may designates an event —e.g., nouns such as giyera ‘war,’ aksidente ‘accident,’ handaan ‘party,’

laro ‘game,’ pulong ‘meeting.’ Thus there are sentences lik:

Nagkakaroon ng prutas sa puno.
‘There is fruit (developing) on the tree.”

(cf. Mayroong prutas sa puno.
‘There is/was fruit on the tree.”)

but there is no:

*Nagkakaprutas sa puno.
(cf. May prutas sa puno.)

Some further examples of possessive verbal constructions are:

Magkakakasama }
ang bawa’t isa.

Magkakaroon ng kasama

‘Each one will get a partner.’

Nagkakalupa }
ang pamilya niya.

Nagkakaroon ng lupa j

‘His family is acquiring land.”

me din sila.
Nagkaroon din sila ng pera.
‘They came to have money too.”

(As the last example illustrates, the position of enclitic particles and pronouns in verbal constructions
telated to phrases with may and mayroon corresponds to their position in the related adjectival

Structures: cf.

(ye pera din sila.
Mayroon din silang pera.

‘They have/had money too.’)

Some further examples of existential verbal constructions are:

Magkakahandaan ba )

mamayang gabi?
Magkakaroon ba ng en
‘Will there be a party (occurring) tonight?’
Nagkakapulong na }

sa opisina ng prinsipal.
Nagkakaroon na ng pulong

§5.30. Imperative, hortative, and optative constructions.

An IMPERATIVE CONSTRUCTION expresses a command or a request. Tagalog has imperative
constructions of five types, which may be called: the BASIC IMPERATIVE, the EQUATIONAL
IMPERATIVE, the IMMEDIATE IMPERATIVE, the ABBREVIATED IMPERATIVE, and the HABITUAL
IMPERATIVE, (There are also a few fixed imperative expressions that are not of these types: e¢.g.,
Halika(yo) ‘Come here,’ Madali kafyo) ‘Hurry up,’ Tuloy kafyo) ‘Come in’; the forms ending in ka are
singular, those in kayo plural.)

The basic imperative is produced by eliminating the aspect marker (cf. §§5.19 through 5.21) from
the predicate verb of a narrational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor. When the aspect
marker is thus eliminated, the basic form of the verb remains. (As is explained in §2.8, the basic form of a
verb consists of a verb base and the basic form of an affix.) To illustrate:

Narrational Imperative
Wawalisan
Winawalisan mo ang sahig. > Walisan mo ang sahig.
Winalisan
will sweep )
*You are sweeping the floor.” > ‘Sweep the floor.’
swept {

(In the illustration, the aspect marker of the narrational—sentence verbs is double—underscored, and the
basic form of the verb is single—-underscored. As the illustration shows, it is the basic form — consisting, in
this case, of the base walis and the suffix -a/- that occurs in the imperative construction.)

In the Tagalog basic imperative, the second—person—pronoun actor is explicitly expressed. In English
imperatives, on the other hand, the explicit subject is not usually present. (The subject ‘you,’ however, may
occur with an emphatic or contrastive meaning: e.g., ‘You finish the cake. (I’m too full.).’ See below for
the Tagalog equivalent of such constructions.)

Not every narrational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor may be converted into
a basic imperative. Certain verbs — e.g., those that include the ability and involuntary—action affixes maka-,
mta-, etc. (cf. §5.13)—do not normally occur in imperative constructions, their meanings being
incompatible with the expression of a command,

Some examples of basic imperative constructions are presented below. The examples represent a
variety of verbal affixes and focuses.

Kumain ka.
‘Eat.’

Maghintay kayo.
‘Wait.’

Manghiram ka ng pera.
“Borrow some money.”

Matulog kayo rito.
‘Sleep here.”

Magpaluto ka ng pagkain.
‘Have some food cooked.”

Basahin mo rin ito.
‘Read this too.”

Ibigay ninyo ito sa kanila.
‘Give this to them."

Lagyan mo ng asin ang sabaw.
‘Put some salt in the soup.”

Isulat mo ako sa Nanay.
‘Write to Mother for me.”

Ipansimba ninyo ang mga iyon.
‘Wear those to church,’

(The initial sa-pronoun actor complement, discussed in §5.25, subsection (1), may occur in a
goal—focus imperative construction, as in goal~focus constructions of other types. Thus:

Iyo ding basahin

ito.
Basahin mo rin
‘Read this too.’)

The equational imperative is produced by eliminating the aspect marker from the nominalized topic
verb (cf. §3.24) of an equational sentence that includes a second—person—pronoun actor. For example:

Equational Imperative
Ito ang BAbasahin mo. Ito ang basahin mo.
‘This is what you'll read.” “Read this,"

In the equational imperative, the element (usually a noun or pronoun) that occurs in predicate position is
emphasized. Compare:

Basic imperative: Basahin mo ito.
‘Read this.’

Equational imperative: Tto ang basahin mo.
‘Read this.”

When the topic verb of an equational imperative is actor-focus, the emphasized predicate is the
second—person—pronoun that expresses the actor. This type of equational imperative is translatable by an
English imperative with the subject you explicitly expressed: e.g.,

Ikaw ang umubos ng keyk. (Masyado akong busog, e.)
“You finish the cake. (I’m too full.)’

The immediate imperative is used to command (or request — sce below) the immediate performance
of an action. An immediate—imperative construction consists of an unaffixed verb base, plus, optionally,
one or more enclitic particles (notably na ‘now’), and lacks any explicit expression of the actor. Not all verb
bases occur in the immediate imperative construction. The bases that do occur in the construction are
roughly the same as those ‘action’ bases that may be nominalized (cf. §3.27). In the immediate imperative,

however, the base is never accompanied by any complement(s). Some examples of the immediate
imperative are:

Alis (na)! Bili (na)!

“Leave!” “Buy (some).’

Inom (na)! Luto (na)!

‘Drink!’ ‘Cook (something).”

404 CHAPTER 5

Kuha (na)! Tanong (na)!
‘Get (some)! “Ask!”

Lakad (na)! Tulog (na)!
‘Go!’ ‘Sleep!’

The abbreviated imperative is derived from a basic imperative that includes a predicate
secondary—actor—focus (A2F) indirect—action verb formed with pa-. .. in (cf. §5.12, subsection (2)) and
a first—person—pronoun topic (ako or kami): e.g.,

Painumin mo/ninyo ako/kami ng tubig.
‘Let me/us have some water.’

In the abbreviated imperative, the suffix -in (of the A2F verb) and the actor complement are deleted,
and the topic is optionally deleted. Thus the abbreviated imperative derived from the basic imperative given
above is:

Painom (ako/kami) ng tubig.
“Let me/us have some water.”

(When the topic is deleted in an abbreviated—imperative construction, either a singular or a plural
first-person topic may be understood.)

Some further examples are:

Paupo (ako/kami) dito.
‘Let me/us sit here.”
(cf. Paupuin mo/ninyo ako/kami dito.)

Pahiram (ako/kami) ng makinilyang iyon.
‘Let me/us borrow that typewriter.’
(cf. Pahiramin mo/ninyo ako/kami ng makinilyang iyon.)

(A2F verbs formed with papag-...-in and papang-...-in do not occur in abbreviated imperative
constructions. As is noted in §5.12, subsection (2), papag-...-in and papang-...-in A2F verbs are
derived, respectively, from mag- and mang- verbs, while pa-... -in A2F verbs are derived from -tm- or ma-
verbs.)

The habitual imperative is derived from a basic or equational imperative by replacing the basic form
of the verb with the contemplated—aspect form. The habitual imperative expresses a demand or request for
habitual or regular action: c.g.,

Mag-aaral ka ng liksyon mo.
‘Study your lessons (regularly).’

(cf. Mag-aral ka ng liksyon mo.
“Study your lesson(s).’)

Ito ang gagawin mo.
‘Do this (regularly).”

(cf. Ito ang gawin mo.
‘Do this.’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 405

(When the meaning of habitual or regular action is expressed explicitly elsewhere in the sentence, this
meaning may be redundantly expressed through the use of a habitual imperative. In such cases, the habitual
imperative alternates freely with the underlying basic or equational imperative: e.g.,

Mageaaral

ka ng liksyon mo gabi-gabi.
Mag-aral \
“Study your lessons every night.’)

(In the case of at least one verb, mag-ingat ‘be careful’ the contemplated—aspect form alternates
freely with the basic form in imperative constructions, and does not necessarily imply habitual or regular
action: e.g.,

Mag-iingat

ka ngayon.
Mag-ingat
‘Be careful now.’)

Any one of the five types of imperatives described above is changed from a command to a polite
request (equivalent to an English imperative with ‘please’) by the inclusion in the sentence of the enclitic
particle nga (cf. §6.4, subsection (b)): ¢.g.,

Kumain ka nga.
‘Please eat.”

Ikaw nga ang umubos ng keyk.
“You please finish the cake.”

Alis (na) nga!
‘Please leave!”

Painom nga ng tubig.
‘Please let me/us have a drink of water.”

Mag-aaral ka nga ng liksyon mo.
‘Please study your lessons (regularly).”

In the case of basic, abbreviated, and habitual imperatives, politeness may also be expressed by the use of
the enclitic particle naman — which, however, usually conveys a meaning of mild reproach or complaint in
addition to that of politeness. For example:

Kumain ka naman.
‘Please eat. (I'll be hurt if you don’t.)

Tulungan mo naman ako,
‘Please help me. (Don’t just sit there.)’

Paupo naman dito.
‘Please let me/us sit here. (Can’t you see I’m/we’re tired?)’

Mag-aaral ka naman ng liksyon mo.
‘Please study your lessons (regularly). (Why do I have to keep asking you?)*

CHAPTER §

Politeness is also expressed by the use of two special request prefixes, maki- and paki-, which cither
teplace or occur in addition to the verbal affix of a basic imperative sentence. Maki- is actor—focus, and
replaces -ain- or mag-. (Mang-, ma-, and maka- actor—focus verbs do not accept the request prefix maki.)
Paki- is goal—focus. It occurs in addition to -an, &, -in, or a complex affix that includes one of these. In
formations that include the request prefix paki-, & is optionally deletable in all cases, and -in is optionally
deletable if it is the only affix in the underlying form: i.e., if the underlying affix is not complex. The
correspondences between the request affixes and the affixes that underlie them are summarized in Chart
22. (The symbol X is used in the chart to represent any affix in addition to the one specified.)

Nga occurs optionally after polite formations with maki- and paki-, increasing the politeness

are:

‘Go to the market.’

Magluto ka ng tinapay.
‘Bake some bread.”

Magpabili ka ng tinapay.
‘Have (someone) buy some bread.”

Hingan mo siya ng piso.
‘Ask him for a peso.”

Pasulatan mo ako kay Ben,
‘Have Ben write to me.’

Iabot mo ang asin.
‘Pass the salt.’

Ipanghiwa mo ito ng karne.
‘Cut some meat with this.’

Linisin mo ang bahay.
‘Clean the house.’

Papag-aralin mo ang bata.
“Let the child study.”

Request
Makipunta ka (nga) sa palengke.
‘Please go to the market.’

Makiluto ka (nga) ng tinapay.
‘Please bake some bread.”

Makipabili ka (nga) ng tinapay.
‘Please have (someone) buy some bread.”

Pakihingan mo (nga) siya ng piso.
‘Please ask him for a peso.”

Pakipasulatan mo (nga) ako kay Ben.
‘Please have Ben write to me.”

(t)pakiabot mo (nga) ang asin.
‘Please pass the salt.”

(I)pakipanghiwa mo (nga) ito ng karne.
‘Please cut some meat with this.”

Pakilinis(in) mo (nga) ang bahay.
‘Please clean the house.’

Pakipapag-aralin mo (nga) ang bata.
‘Please let the child study.”

(It may be noted that maki- plus the base of an -wm- verb is ambiguous, since maki- in such a context may
be interpreted as either the basic form of the social—verb prefix maki- — cf. §5.14 — or the request prefix.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 407

Thus makipunta may mean either ‘go with’ or ‘please go.’ In the case of mag- bases, on the other hand,
there is no ambiguity, since the social—verb prefix that occurs with a mag- base is makipag- while the
request prefix that occurs with such a base is maki-. Thus: makipagluto ‘cook with’ but makiluto ‘please
cook.’)

A HORTATIVE CONSTRUCTION expresses the speaker’s wish that he and the person(s) addressed
perform some action, Hortative constructions are equivalent to English constructions introduced by
‘let’s: e.g., ‘Let’s eat.” Tagalog has two hortative constructions: the BASIC HORTATIVE and the
EQUATIONAL HORTATIVE., Like the basic imperative, the basic hortative has the basic form of a verb in
predicate position. Like the equational imperative, the equational hortative has the basic form of a verb in
topic position. In the hortative constructions, however, the performer of the action is expressed by a dual
plural (inclusive first-person plural) pronoun, rather than the second—person pronoun of the imperative
constructions. Some examples of basic hortative constructions are:

Kumain tayo.
‘Let’s eat.’

Basahin natin ang librong ito.
‘Let’s read this book.”

Walisan natin ang sahig.
‘Let’s sweep the floor.”

Some examples of equational hortative constructions are:

Tayo ang lumakad.
‘Let's you and me walk.’

lyon ang gawin natin.
‘Let’s do that.”

Ang mga bago ang ipang-iskwela natin.
‘Let’s wear the new ones to school.”

(In addition to basic and equational hortative constructions, Tagalog has at least one fixed expression of
hortative meaning: Tayo na — frequently contracted to Tena — Let’s go.’)

The enclitic particles nga and naman may be used to add a meaning of politeness to hortatives as to
imperatives (see above). Nga is used in this way in both basic and equational hortatives, naman only in basic
hortatives. As in the case of imperatives, naman suggests mild reproach or complaint as well as politeness.
Examples are:

Dalawin nga natin ang Lola.
‘Please, let’s visit Grandmother.’

Tayo nga ang maglinis ng bahay.
‘Let’s you and me clean house, please.’

Umalis naman tayo.
‘Let’s leave, please. (We've stayed long enough.)’

OPTATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS, like hortative constructions, express the speaker’s wish that an
action be performed. In the case of optative constructions, however, the action is to be performed by some
person(s) other than the speaker and the person(s) addressed. There are no productive optative
constructions in English. In place of such constructions English normally uses constructions introduced by
‘I’ plus a verb of optative meaning: e.g., ‘I want him to go,” ‘I hope he wins.’ (English does, however, use
optative constructions in certain fixed phrases: e.g., ‘May the best man win,’ *Long live the King!’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
408 CHAPTER 5

While Tagalog has constructions paralleling the English constructions with ‘I’ plus a verb of optative
meaning (e.g., Gusto Kong pumunta siya ‘1 want him to go,’ Umaasa akong mananalo siya ‘I hope he wins’),
it also has two productive optative constructions: the BASIC OPTATIVE and the EQUATIONAL
OPTATIVE. The basic optative, like the basic imperative and hortative, has the basic form of a verb in
predicate position. The equational optative, like the equational imperative and hortative, has the basic form
of a verb in topic position.

The enclitic particle SANA (cf. §6.5, subsection (e)) is of frequent occurrence in optative
constructions. The inclusion of sana in such a construction changes the meaning of the construction from
the expression of a wish to the expression of a hope. Sana, or one of certain other enclitic particles (see

below), is obligatory in optative constructions in which the actor is expressed by something other than a
third—person pronoun, Thus:

ng katulong
ni Maria
Makita sana ang singsing.
namin
nito

the maid finds
Maria finds
‘l hope the ring.’
we (I and others) find
this one finds

but not:

ng katulong
ni Maria

*Makita ang singsing.
namin

nito

Enclitic particles other than sana that may occur in optative constructions include Kaya, nga
and — for some speakers — ba. These particles differ from one another in meaning, but have in common the
expression of some kind of uncertainty about whether the wished—for action is actually to be performed.
Some examples are:

Tumawag kaya ng duktor ang Tatay.
‘Perhaps Father should call the doctor.”

Dumalaw nga si Manuel sa kaniya (at nang magkausap sila).
‘I would like Manuel to visit him (so that they can talk).”

Tingnan ko nga iyon?
‘May I see that?’

Hugasan ko ba ang pinggan?
‘Should I wash the dishes?’

For some speakers, sana or some other enclitic particle is also obligatory when the actor in an

optative construction is expressed by a third—person pronoun. Other speakers, however, accept such
sentences as:

VERBALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 409

Some further examples of the basic optative construction are:
Mangisda
sila.
Mangisda sana
want them to

‘4 go fishing.”
hope they

Makita sana ni Joe iyan.
‘Lhope Joe sees that.’

Some examples of the equational optative are:

Si Linda
ang piliin niya.
Si Linda sana

( want him to choose )

‘l Linda.”

l hope he chooses {

Ako sana ang yumaman.
‘I hope J get rich.”

Si Rosa sana ang magluto.
‘T hope Rosa does the cooking.’

Adverbials and Their Expansions

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 41

86.1. litéodiiction.

As was noted in §2.14, two major classes of adverbials occur optionally in basic
sentences: ENCLITIC PARTICLES, a class of words that occur only in certain fixed word—order relations
to other sentence elements, and MOVABLE ADVERBS, a class of words and phrases that may occupy any
of several different sentence positions. In addition to these, Tagalog has three other classes of
adverbials: INITIAL ADVERBS, SENTENCE-FINAL PARTICLES, and ADVERBIAL CLAUSES. Initial
adverbs, which may be words or phrases, occur only at the beginning of a sentence or clause.
Sentence—final particles, a small class of words, occur only at the end of a sentence. Adverbial clauses are
distinguished from adverbials of other types by the fact that they have a sentence—like internal structure.

The Tagalog adverbials are presented below as follows: enclitic particles in § §6.2 through 6.6;
movable adverbs in §§6.7 through 6.11; initial adverbs in §6.12; sentence—final particles in §6.13;
adverbial clauses in § §6.14 through 6.18.

§6.2. Enclitic particles: introduction.
Tagalog has cighteen ENCLITIC PARTICLES (or ENCLITIC ADVERBS): viz.,

ba {bah/ na {nah/
kasi /kasih/ naman {naman}
kaya Ikaya’} nga fna’}
daw~raw /daw/~/raw/ pa {pah/
din~tin {din/~/rin{ pala fpalah{
ho {ho’} po !po’}
lamang~lang fla‘man/~/la(+)n/ sana fsa‘nah/
man /man/ tuloy ftuloy/
muna {mu'nah/ yata fya‘ta’}

(Daw and raw are free alternants, as are din and rin, lamang and lang; vowel length in eng is optional.)
From the point of view of the meanings they express (cf. §§6.3—5), the enclitic particles constitute a
rather heterogeneous grouping. They are similar to one another, however, in that they all manifest
ENCLITIC behavior.

As was explained in §3.5, the enclitics of Tagalog are words that, with certain statable exceptions,
obligatorily follow the first word of the construction of which they constitute an immediate part. (Cf. §6.6
for an explanation of IMMEDIATE PART with reference to the enclitic pronouns.) Note, for example, the
differences in sentence position between the enclitic particle na ‘now, any longer’ and the non-enclitic
adverb ngayon ‘today’ in the following sentences:

(1) Naroon na si Rosa.
“Rosa is there now.”

(si Rosa ngayon.
(cf. Naroon

ngayon si Rosa.
‘Rosa is there today.’)

(2) Wala na roon si Rosa.
‘Rosa isn’t there any longer.”

fsi Rosa ngayon.
(cf. Wala roon

ngayon si Rosa.
‘Rosa isn’t there today,’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
412 CHAPTER 6

Na —which is an immediate part of the predicate in these examples — follows the first word of the
predicate in each case, and can occur in no other position: there are no such sentences as *Naroon si Rosa
na, etc. (In Sentence (1), 2a follows the one-—word predicate, naroon; in sentence (2), it comes between the
two words of the negated predicate.) Ngayon on the other hand, shows a range of possible sentence
positions in cach case (cf. §2.18) and while this range in some cases includes a position after the first word
of the predicate (¢.g., Naroon ngayon si Rosa) in other cases it does not (there is no “Wala ngayon roon si
Rosa).

Tagalog has, in addition to enclitic particles, enclitic pronouns (which are presented in detail in
§3.29). When a sentence includes a particle and a pronoun both of which are enclitic to the same word, the
following rules of order obtain:

(1) _ the monosyllabic pronouns ka, ko, and mo precede any enclitic particle(s);
(2) all other enclitic pronouns follow any enclitic particle(s).

Examples of the operation of these rules are:

Kumakain ka na.
“You (sg.) are eating now.’

ako.
siya.
kami.
Kumakain na
tayo.
kayo,
sila.
‘lam
‘He is
‘We are
eating now.’
“We are
‘You (pl.) are

‘Lam

‘You (sg.) are j

nila
‘He is
‘We are
‘We are eating the food now.”
‘You (pl.) are
‘They are

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 413

The rules also apply to sequences of encliti¢s that include two enclitic pronouns and one or more enclitic
particles. Thus:

ka na niya.
Nakikita mo na siya.
ko na siya.
‘He sees you (sg.)
‘You (sg.) see him now.”
‘Lsee him
( niya ako.
Nakikita na namin kayo.
l ninyo sila.
‘He sees me
‘We see you (pl.) now.”
You (pl.) see them

Kita, the composite pronoun that replaces the non-occurring sequence *ko ka, follows any enclitic
particles. Thus:

Nakikita na kita.
‘I see you (sg.) now.”

For rules governing the order of enclitic pronouns relative to one another, cf. §3.29.

When two or more particles are enclitic to the same word, their relative order may be described in
terms of the following order classes:

Class 1: fa, pa

Class 2: man

Class 3(a): ba, din, kasi, ho, lamang, nga, po
(b): daw, muna, naman

Class 4: kaya, pala, sana, tuloy, yata

The two particles that belong to class I never occur in imediate sequence with one another, and are
never preceded by any other enclitic particles. Thus:

na }
Kumain nga kayo.
pa |
{ now.”
‘Please cat

| some more.”
( na
Nagtatrabaho pala kayo roon.
pa

now )

‘So you're working there.”

still j

etc.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
4i4 CHAPTER 6

Man, the only particle belonging to class 2, never precedes a particle belonging to class | and never
follows a particle belonging to class 3 or 4. Thus:

Hindi pa man lamang tuloy nakakapag-almusal si Juan.
“As a result, Juan hasn't even had breakfast yet.”

Class 3 is divided into two subclasses on the basis of the behavior of the two subclasses with respect
to particles belonging to class 4. Those class 3 particles listed in subclass 3(a) never follow a class 4 particle;
those listed in subclass 3(b) may follow a class 4 particle (see below).

Two of the class 3 particles, ho and po, never occur in the same sentence. Subject to this restriction,
two or more particles belonging to class 3 may occur in any order relative to one another. There are,
however, certain preferred orderings that obtain within the class. When two or more class 3 particles occur
in sequence, the most common position of any one particle relative to the others is shown in the following
formula:

ho )

nga + din/rin + lamang/lang + daw/raw + + ba + muna + naman + kasi
po |

That is, nga preferably precedes any other class 3 parsticle(s), din preferably precedes any class 3 particle(s)
other than nga lamang preferably precedes any class particle(s) other than nga and din, etc. Some examples
are:

Nagtatrabaho nga rin daw kayo roon.
‘They say it’s true that you’re working there too.’

Nagtatrabaho rin ho ba kayo roon?
‘Are you working there too, sir?’

Nagtatrabaho daw ba naman kayo roon?
‘Do they say that you're working there instead?"

(It should be noted that the relative positions shown in the above formula are merely preferences, and that
other orderings can occur. In a few cases, in fact, some other ordering may be just as common as the one
shown in the formula. For example, when raw(or daw) and ba occur as the only enclitics in a sequence, the
ordering ba raw is quite as normal as the osdering raw ba: c¢.g.,

j ba raw
Nagtatrabaho kayo roon?
raw ba

‘Do they say that you're working there?" )

The particles belonging to class 4 never precede particles belonging to classes 1, 2, and 3(a). They
may, however, precede a particle belonging to class 3(b), although an ordering in which the class 3(b)
particle precedes the class 4 particle is preferred. Thus while both of the following are possible, the first
represents a more common ordering:

j raw kaya
Hindi mabuti iyon,
kaya raw

‘I wonder if they say that's not good.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 415

Particles belonging to class 4 may occur in any order relative to one another, but sang preferably

peterets ists t Ir)

follows any of the others, and tuloy preferably follows any of the others except sara. Some examples are:

( yata pala)
Nabili hiya ang damit.
pala yata

‘Oh, I think he got to buy the clothes.”

Nabili kaya tuloy niya ang damit.
‘I wonder if, as a result, he got to buy the clothes.’

Nabili tuloy sana niya ang damit.
‘l hope that it turns out that he got to buy the clothes.’

The meanings and uses of the enclitic particles are presented in §6.3 through 6.5: class | particles in
$6.3; class 2 and class 3 particles in §6.4; class 4 particles in §6.5. The order of enclitic particles in relation
to non-enclitic sentence elements is presented in §6.6.

§6.3. Class 1 enclitic particles.

The two class 1 enclitic particles, na and pa, never occur in immediate sequence with one another.
They may, however, be used in separate clauses of a single sentence (cf. discussion under (7), below), Their
most common uses are the following:

(1) In non-imperative sentences beginning with point—time adverbs expressing future time (cf.
§6.8) —e.g., bukas ‘tomorrow,’ sa Linggo ‘next Sunday,’ sa isang linggo ‘next week’ — na and pa indicate
the speaker’s attitude toward the length of time between the time expressed by the adverb and the moment
of speaking. Pa extends the psychological distance between the two points of time; na reduces it. After
point—time adverbs expressing past time — e.g., Kahapon ‘yesterday,’ noong Linggo ‘last Sunday,’ noong
isang linggo ‘last week’ — pa performs this same function of extending the psychological distance between
the time expressed by the adverb and the moment of speaking; na, however, does not occur after past
point—time adverbs. Examples are:

Sa Linggo pa ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta is next Sunday (and there is plenty of time between now and then).’

Sa Linggo na ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta is next Sunday (and there is little time between now and then).”

Noong Linggo pa ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta was Jast Sunday (and that was quite a while ago).”

(Compare with the above:

s |
Linggo ang piyesta.
Noong {
{ is next
‘The fiesta Sunday.’
was last

These sentences are noncommittal about the speaker’s attitude toward the length of time between the time
expressed by the adverb and the moment of speaking.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
416 CHAPTER 6

(2) In imperative sentences (cf. §5.30) and with predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect, na
denotes immediate initiation or performance of the action, pa continuation or resumption of the action. In
these contexts ia is usually translatable by ‘now,’ pa by ‘some more’ or ‘go on.” Examples are:

j na
Kumain ka
tee
now.”
‘Eat some more,”

or ‘Go on eating.”

{na
linitin ko ang pagkain.
paf

( now.’
‘T’ll heat the food

some more.”
or ‘I'll go on heating the food.”

With predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect, pa may also denote postponement of other actions
in favor of the action expressed by the verb, as in:

Hindi ako makaaalis ngayon; maglalaba pa ako.
‘I can’t leave right now; I still have to do the laundry.”

Mahuhuli ako ng kaunti; patutulugin ko pa ang bata.
‘T ll be a little late; I must put the baby to bed first.’

(3) With predicate verbs in the imperfective aspect and with non-verbal predicates, na suggests that
the situation expressed is a relatively new or altered one, pa that it is a relatively old or continuing one. In
these contexts, na is usually translatable by ‘now’ or ‘already,’ pa by ‘still.’ Examples are:

Nasa bahay | si Rosa.

(=

j now/already

‘Rosa is in the house.”
| still
na
Natutulog ang bata.
pa
j now
‘The child is sleeping.’
l still

(4) With predicate verbs in the perfective aspect, na indicates performance of the action expressed by
the verb at some unspecified time prior to another time. The time prior to which the action is performed

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 417

may be the moment of speaking, in which case the English equivalent often involves ‘has/have’ (plus,
optionally, ‘already’) plus a past participle: e.g.,

Umalis na si Manuel.
‘Manuel has (already) left."

(cf. Umalis si Manuel.
‘Manuel left.")

Or the time prior to which the action is performed may be designated by some past or future point—time
expression. In this case, if the sentence includes a past time expression, the English equivalent usually
involves ‘had’ (plus ‘already’) plus a past participle; if the sentence includes a future time expression, the
English equivalent usually involves ‘will’ (plus ‘already’) plus ‘have’ plus a past participle: e.g.,

Nakarating na si Manuel nang nangyari iyon.
‘Manuel had (already) arsived when it happened.”

Nakarating na si Manuel bago mangyari iyon.
‘Manuel will (already) have arrived when it happens.”
(literally: ‘... before it happens.’)

With predicate verbs in the perfective aspect, pa indicates performance of the action expressed by the
verb in addition to some other action(s), and is usually translatable by English ‘also’ or ‘too’: ¢.g.,

Nagpunta pa ako sa post office.
‘I also went to the post office.’

(cf. Nagpunta ako sa post office.
‘I went to the post office.)

(5) Pa is frequently used with verbs in the recent—perfective aspect (cf. §5.23). The meaning of the
sentence is not affected by the presence or absence of pa: e.g.,

Kaaalis (pa) lamang ni Pedro.
‘Pedro has just left.”

Na does not occur with verbs in the recent—perfective aspect.

(6) Na is often used to indicate a change in some previous plan. This meaning is most frequently
associated with sentences that have nominalized verbal topics (cf. §3.24), or that have an adverb or
complement occurring in initial position in emphatic inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (3)). Pa has no
comparable function.

Ikaw na ang mamili.
‘You'd better do the shopping (e.g., instead of me, as originally planned).”

Bukas ka na umalis.
‘Leave tomorrow (e.g., instead of today).”

Dito ka na matulog ngayong gabi.
‘Sleep here tonight (e.g., instead of going home).’

418 CHAPTER 6

(7) Pa may be used to express the meaning ‘in addition.” It most frequently occurs in this meaning
after an interrogative word (cf. § §7.7 through 7.11) or a cardinal number (cf. §4.4). With an interrogative

word it is usually translatable by ‘else; with a cardinal number it is usually translatable by ‘more.’ Examples
are:

Sino pa ang paparito?
‘Who else is coming?’

Saan ka pa pumunta?
‘Where else did you go?’

May isa pa akong itatanong.
‘L have one more thing to ask.’

Dalawa pa ngang tasang kape.
‘Two more cups of coffee, please.’

Na has no comparable function.
(8) Na and pa are used in successive clauses (cf. §6.17, subsection (5)) to indicate incompatibility
between the actions, conditions, etc. expressed by the clauses. In some cases, the clause that includes pa

expresses a continuing condition that might have been expected to prevent, but does not prevent, the
action expressed by the clause that includes ma: e.g.,

Hilaw pa ang mangga, pinitas na ni Juan.
‘The mango was still unripe, but Juan picked it anyway.”

May sakit pa siya, pumasok na siya sa iskwela.
‘He was still sick, but he went to school anyway.”

In other cases, the clause that includes ma expresses a new condition, or a condition unspecified as to
newness or continuity, that might have been expected to prevent, but does not prevent, the action
expressed by the clause that includes pa: e.g.,

Dumarating na ang mga bisita, maglilinis ka pa ng bahay!
‘The guests are already arriving, and you're going to clean house!”

May sakit na siya, pumasok pa siya sa iskwela.
‘He was sick, but he went to school anyway.’

(The clauses may occur in either order. Thus, also:

Pinitas ni Juan ang mangga, hilaw pa.
‘Juan picked the mango, although it was still unripe.’

Maglilinis ka pa ng bahay, dumarating na ang mga bisita!
‘You're going to clean house, and the guests are already arriving!’)

(9), In negated constructions (cf. §§7.13 through 7.15), na and pa together with the negators,
express the following meanings:

(a) hindi na ‘not... any more/longer’
Hindi na ako pupunta roon.
‘I won't go there any more.’

Hindi ko na kailangan iyon.
‘I don’t need that any longer.”

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 419

(b) Aindi pa ‘not... yet.’
Hindi pa siya aalis.
‘He won't be leaving yet.’

Hindi pa siya umaalis.
‘He hasn't left yet."

(Note that the meaning ‘has not ... yet’ is expressed by hindi pa and a verb in the imperfective
aspect — cf. §2.7.)

(c) wala na ‘no more/longer, not . . . any more/longer’
Wala nang tubig sa pitsel.
‘There isn’t any more water in the pitcher.’

Wala na rito si Juan.
‘Juan is no longer here.”

(d) wala pa ‘no... yet, not (any)... yet
Wala pa siyang kaibigan dito.
‘He has no friends here yet.”

Wala pa rito si Juan.
‘Juan isn't here yet.’

(ce) huwag na ‘don’t... any more’
Huwag na ninyo siyang abalahin.
‘Don’t bother him any more.”

(*Huwag pa docs not occur; the meaning ‘don’t . . . yet’ is expressed by huwag muna: cf. §6.4,
subsection (h.3).)

§6.4. Class 2 and class 3 enclitic particles.

In the following presentation, the class 2 and class 3 particles are presented in the following
order: (a) man, (b) nga, (c) din/rin, (d) lamang/lang, (e) daw/raw, (f) ho and po, (g) ba, (h) muna, (i)
naman, (j) kasi. (The one class 2 particle man, is presented first; the class 3 particles are presented in the
order in which they preferably occur when in sequence with one another — cf. §6.2).

(a) Man
Man does not occur in basic sentences. Its most common uses are the following:

(1) with the negators hindi and wala (cf. §§7.13 and 7.14) and the class 3 enclitic
lamang/lang in sentences equivalent to English sentences with ‘not even’: ¢.g.,

Hindi ka man lamang nakapag-almusal.
‘You didn’t even get to eat breakfast.’

Wala man lang siya roon.
‘He wasn't even there.’

(2) _ in concessive clauses (cf. §6.17, subsection (4)) equivalent to English clauses with ‘even
if or ‘even though.’ (The concessive clause is optionally introduced by kahit. The main

CHAPTER 6

clause optionally but commonly includes the class 3 enclitic dinfrin — in this context
‘still, anyway.’) Examples are:

(Kahit) mahal man ang sapatos, binili ko rin.
‘Even though the shoes were expensive, I bought them anyway.”

Hindi ka rin maniniwala, (kahit) sabihin ko man ang totoo.
‘You still won’t believe it, even if I tell you the truth.’

in indefinite constructions (cf. §7.18), equivalent to English constructions with
‘whatever,’ ‘whoever,’ etc. (The construction is, once more, optionally introduced by
kahit.) Examples are:

(Kahit) ano man ang gusto mo, ibibili kita.
“Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you.”

{ sa kahit sino
Sabihin mo ‘ pa mang dumating na umuwi na ako.
kanino

‘Tell whoever else comes that I’ve gone home.’

(Kahit) saan man ako pumunta, nakikita ko siya.
‘Wherever I go, I see him.”

with an inverted topic followed by ay or a pause (cf. §7.2), in which case the inverted
predicate obligatorily includes din/rin. The sentence expresses an unexpected similarity
between the referent of the topic and something or someone clse: c.g.,

{man ay

Ako natakot din.
man,

‘I too was scared (although I might not have been expected to be).”

{ man ay )
Ang kalabaw napapagod din.
man,

“(The) carabaos too get tired (although they might not have been expected to).’

When, as in the last example, the inverted topic that precedes man is an unmarked noun
oreceded hy ang, it may have either a definite or a generic meaning (e.g.. ‘the carabaos’ or
‘carabaos’). The ang is, however, optionally deletable in this construction, in which case
the topic always has a generic meaning. Thus:

{man ay)
Kalabaw napapagod din.
man, f

‘Carabaos too get tired.”

(While there is normally both a stylistic difference and a difference in meaning between a
sentence in which an inverted topic is followed by the inversion marker ay and one in
which it is followed by a pause — cf. §7.2, subsections (1) and (2) — only the stylistic
difference obtains in the case of the construction under discussion. That is, in the
man-din inversion construction, the only difference between a sentence in which the
inversion is marked by ay and an otherwise identical sentence in which it is marked by a

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 421

Pause is that the former represents the more formal style. This same generalization applies
to the man-din inverted—adverb construction presented under (5), immediately below.)

(5) with an inverted adverb followed by ay or a pause (cf. §7.2), in which case the following
construction obligatorily includes din/rin. In this construction man is usually translatable
by ‘even,’ din by ‘still’: eg.,

makapagsasa-
j maliit ay
Sa loob man ng bahay naming yaman din
maliit,
tayo.

‘Even inside our little house, we can still hold the dance.”

Kung gabi man, mainit din.
‘Even at night, it’s still hot.’

(6) in the first of two structures (words, phrases, etc.) joined by the coordinating conjunction
o ‘or’ (cf. §7.19, subsection (2)). A coordinate construction that includes man and o is
equivalent to an ‘either . . . or’ construction in English: e.g.,

ikaw man o ako ay maaaring gumawa niyon.
‘Either you or I can do that.’

Sa loob man o sa labas ay maaari tayong magsayawan.
“We can hold the dance either indoors or outdoors.’

(b) Nga
(J) The addition of nga to an imperative sentence (cf. §5.30) changes the imperative from a
command to a polite request: e¢.g.,

Kumain ka nga. ‘Please eat.’

(cf. Kumain ka.
‘Eat’)

(An imperative that includes ga may retain the imperative intonation pattern, /32/, or it
may receive an intonation used only for requests, /32t/ — cf. §1.24, pattern I.1 and
§1.27, pattern IV.3. The latter intonation pattern makes the request more polite.)

(2) Aga is also commonly used in hostative and optative constructions (cf. §5.30). In a
hortative construction, mga serves to clicit consent to the suggested course of action: ¢.g.,

Tingnan nga natin iyon.
‘How about our looking at that.’

(cf. Tingnan natin iyon.
‘Let’s look at that.")

In an optative construction (where some sort of enclitic particle is often obligatory) nga is
used in expressing a wish of moderate force: e.g.,

Linisin ko nga ang bahay.
“I guess I should clean the house.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
422

(3)

CHAPTER 6

In sentences other than imperatives and optatives, nga usually expresses affirmation or
confirmation. Examples are:

Oo nga.
“Yes, indeed.’

Ikaw nga ang matalino, e!
“On the contrary, it’s really you who are the intelligent one!”

Pagod nga ako.
‘I'm really tired.”

(c) Dinfrin

(d)

Q)

Q)

(3)

Some speakers use din and rin as free alternants in all phonemic contexts. Others prefer
din after consonants rin after vowels. Dinfrin is commonly used in the following ways:
to express similarity between two situations. In this use, din/rin is usually translatable by
‘too’ (in an affirmative sentence) or by ‘either’ (in a negative sentence). Examples are:

(Umaawit si Linda.) Umaawit din si Carmen.
‘(Linda is singing.) Carmen is singing too.’

Hindi marunong ng Kastila si Pedro. Hindi rin siya marunong ng salitang Pranses.
‘(Pedro doesn’t know Spanish.) He doesn’t know French either.’

to express the achievement of some more-or-less long—desired goal. In this use, din/rin
is usually translatable by ‘finally’ or ‘at last.’ Examples are:

Natapos din ang trabaho.
“We've finally finished the job.”

Salamat sa Diyos, nakita ko rin ang kuwintas kong nawawala.
‘Thank God, I've found my missing necklace at last.’

to express a moderate degree of the quality expressed by an adjective, or to partially
negate the adjective. In this use, din/rin is usually translatable by ‘fairly’ or ‘not very.’
Examples are:

(Kumusta?) Mabuti rin.

(‘How are you?’) ‘Fairly well.’

(Maganda ba si Maria?) Oo, maganda rin.

(‘Is Maria pretty?") “Yes, but not very (pretty).’”
(4) in association with man in various constructions — cf. (a.2), (a.4), and (a.5), above.
Lamang/tang

Lamang, or its shortened variant, Jang, commonly expresses a meaning of limitation (in
quantity, extent, importance, etc.) with respect to the construction of which it is an immediate
part. It is usually translatable by ‘only’ or ‘just.’ Examples are:

Tatlo lamang sila.
‘There are only three of them.’

Si Juan lang ang dumating.
‘The only one who came was Juan.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 423

Mangungulot lang ako.
‘I'm only a hairdresser.”

Kaninang umaga ko lamang natanggap ito.
‘It was just this morning that I received this.”

Maghintay ka sandali; magsusuot lang ako ng sapatos.
“Wait a moment; I'll just put on my shoes.”

(For examples of the use of lamang/lang with man after the negators hindi and wala, cf.
(a.1), above.)

Lamang or lang is obligatory after a verb in the recent—perfective aspect (cf.
§5.23): eg.,

Kakakain ko lamang.
‘I have just eaten.’

(e) Daw/raw
Some speakers use daw and raw as free alternants in all phonemic contexts. Others prefer
daw after consonants, raw after vowels. Daw/raw is used to mark indirect quotations (cf.
§3.28, subsection (2)), or in sentences that report or elicit the content of something said by
someone other than the speaker or the person(s) addressed. In some cases it may be translated
by ‘they say’ or ‘ say(s)/said’; in other cases it lacks a common English translation
equivalent. Examples are:

 

Sabi ng Nanay, manguha ka raw ng gulay.
‘Mother said that you should pick some vegetables.’

Saan daw pupunta si Juan?
‘Where did Juan say he was going?’
(or ‘Where did they say Juan was going?’)

Mabuti raw ang ani.
‘They say that the harvest is good.’

(f) Hoand po

Ho and po are used to express respect for the person or persons being addressed. The
social circumstances in which they are used are the same as those in which the second—person
plural pronouns kayo/ninyo/inyo and third—person—plural pronouns sila/nila/kanila replace the
second—person—singular pronouns. (In prayers addressed to God or the saints, however, po
(but not ho) is used with ikaw, etc.) Neither of these enclitics of respect occurs after the
familiar affirmative reply Oo ‘Yes.’ Instead of *Oo po or *0o ho, special polite
forms -- respectively, Opo and Oho — are used. Po is more formal and respectful than ho. Ho is
the more commonly used of the two especially among younger speakers, except in social
formulas (cf. §7.23), where po is the more common form. Examples are:

Magandang umaga po, Ginoong Cruz.
‘Good moming, Mr. Cruz.”

(cf. Magandang umaga, Carmen.
‘Good morning, Carmen.")

( ho )

Alam | ba ninyo kung anong oras ang alis ng bus?
po

*Do you know, (sir/madam), what time the bus leaves?’

(g) Ba

CHAPTER 6

Ba is the question marker (cf. §§7.3 through 7.12). Its use is optional except in the

confirmation—question formulas hindi ba, hindi ba’t, and dili nga ba't. It is more frequently
omitted in information questions (i.c., those with interrogative words like saan ‘where,’ sino
‘who.” ilan ‘how many,’) than in yes—no questions. Examples are:

Aalis ka na (ba)?
‘Are you leaving now?*

Saan ka (ba) nakatira?
‘Where do you live?’

Libro mo ito, hindi ba?
‘This is your book, isn’t it?”

(A variant form, baga, occurs in some regional dialects, but is not found in educated

Manila Tagalog.)
(h) = Muna.

qd)

(2)

(3)

Muna adds a meaning of temporariness, or anticipation of change, to the meaning
expressed by the rest of the sentence.

Where the nature of the anticipated change is not expressed, muna is often translatable by
‘for a while,’ ‘for the time being,’ ‘(for) a minute,” etc. Examples are:

Magpahinga muna tayo.
“Let's rest for a while (and then...)

Hagay mo muna doon.
“Put it there for the time being.”

Teka muna.
‘Wait a minute.’

Diyan muna kayo.
‘So long.”

(Literally: ‘You (stay) there for a while’: the social formula for temporary
leavetaking ~ cf. §7.23).

Where the nature of the anticipated change is expressed or clearly implied, muna is often
translatable by ‘first’: e.g.,

Bago siya nag-aral ng liksyon, nagbabasa muna siya ng diyaryo.
‘Before studying his lessons, he reads the newpapers (first).’

In negative imperatives and hortatives (cf. §5.30), muna is often translatable by

‘6, .

yet’: e.g.,

Huwag ka munang kumain.
‘Don’t eat yet.”

Huwag muna tayong umalis.
‘Let’s not leave yet.”

(i) Noman

Naman is commonly used in the following ways:

(1) to express dissimilarity between two situations. In this use, it is sometimes translatable by
‘on the other hand’ or ‘instead,’ although these expressions are Jess common in English
than naman is in Tagalog. Examples are:

Nag-aaral si Linda. Naglalaro naman si Carmen.
‘Linda is studying. Carmen ( -- on the

other hand — ) is playing.’
Bumili ako ng karne kahapon. Ngayon, isda naman.
‘I bought meat yesterday. Today, (it will be)

‘fish (instead).”

(2) to express a shift of viewpoint from one person, object, etc. to another, or a shift of role
from questioner to responder or vice versa. In these uses, nanian usually lacks a
translation equivalent in English. Examples are:

Juan ang pangalan ko. At ang iyo naman?
*My name is Juan. And yours?’
Kumusta ka? Mabuti. Ikaw naman?
“How are you?’ ‘Fine. And you?’

(3) in imperative sentences (cf. §5.30), to express politeness together with mild reproach.
Examples are:

Magpahinga ka naman. ‘Do rest.’

Huwag naman kayong maingay. ‘Please don’t be noisy.”

(Imperative sentences with naman do not get the intonation pattern for requests or that
for commands, but, rather, the emphatic statement pattern, /234/ — cf. §1.26, pattern
IIL.1.)

(4) after adjectives used as predicates, and after adjectives or adjective bases in exclamations
(cf. §4.24), to express a critical or negative attitude. Examples are:

Marumi
naman ito.
Mahal
{ dirty )
‘This is (and 1 am displeased.)’
| expensive \
{ Marumi
(cf. ito.
} Mahal
( dirty.” }
‘This is (statement of fact) )
| expensive.” {
Napakarumi

(j) = Kasi

CHAPTER 6

Kasi expresses cause. [t is used only in informal speech, being replaced in writing and in

formal speech by constructions with dahil or sapagka’t ‘because.’ Examples are:

Nagising ang bata. Maingay kasi kayo, e.

‘The baby was awakened. (That’s) because you were noisy.”

Nahuli si Juan sa klase. Tanghali na kasi siyang nagising, ¢.
‘Juan was late for class. (That’s) because he slept late.”

(Kasi is also used as a non-enclitic adverb, as in:

Nahuli si Juan sa klase. Kasi, tanghali na siyang nagising, e.
‘Juan was late for class. (That's) because he slept late.” )

§6.5. Class 4 enclitic particles.
The class 4 enclitic particles are presented below in the following order: (a) Kaya, (b), pala, (c) yata,
(d) tuloy, (e) sana.

(a) Kaya

q)

Kaya expresses or elicits speculation. It occurs in: (1) speculative imperatives, optatives,
and hortatives; and (2) speculative questions.
Kaya may occur in a basic or equational imperative, a basic of equational optative, ora
basic or equational hortative construction (cf. §5.30). The addition of kaya to such a
construction changes the meaning from that of expressing a command or a wish that an
action be performed to that of expressing speculation about the desirability of the action.
The English equivalents usually involve: ‘Perhaps. . . should.’ Examples are:

kayo
tayo
Maglakad kaya doon.
ako
si Juan
you
we
‘Perhaps should walk there.’
l

Ito kaya ang gamitin
ko.
ni Juan.
you
we
‘Perhaps should use this.’
I
Juan

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 427

(Note that, while the actor in an optative construction without kaya (or sana — cf.e.1),
below) is always expressed by a personal pronoun, the actor in a speculative optative with
kaya may be expressed by a nominal of some other type as well. Thus while there is no
*Maglakad si Juan doon, the sentence Maglakad kaya si Juan doon is perfectly
acceptable.)

(2) Kaya occurs in ycs—no questions (cf. §7.4), alternative questions (§7.5), and
information questions (§§7.7 ff.). When kaya is used in a question, the
question—marking enclitic ba (cf. §6.4, subsection (e)) is usually omitted. In questions,
kaya elicits the speculative opinion of the person(s) addressed, and is often translatable
by ‘do you suppose.” Examples are:

Mabuti kaya ang ani?
“Do you suppose the harvest will be good?”

Naglakad kaya sila, o sumakay?
‘Do you suppose they walked, or rode?”

Sino kaya ang mananalo?
‘Who do you suppose will win?’

(Speculative imperatives, optatives, and hortatives may be changed to speculative
questions by the use of an interrogative intonation pattern (/2t/, /31t/, or
1314] — respectively, pattern 1.2, §1.24, pattern II1.3, §1.26, and pattern IV.4,

§1.27): eg.,
ninyo?

Ito kaya ang gamitin
ko?
ni Juan?

we
“Do you suppose should use this?’)
I
Juan

(b) Pala
Pala is used in expressing mild surprise at new information, or an unexpected event or
situation, as in the first and second examples below, or in expressing an afterthought, as in the
third and fourth examples.

Ikaw pala ang kapatid ni Pedro.
‘So you’re Pedro’s sister.”

Maganda pala ito, a!
‘Oh, but this is pretty!”

Ano pala ang bibilhin ko para si iyo?
“By the way, what shall ] buy for you?’

Kunin mo pala ang martilyo.
‘(And ... oh, yes,) get the hammer.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
CHAPTER 6

{c) Yata
Yara is used in statements (not in questions or imperatives) to express uncertainty
or Jack of conviction. Examples are:

Mahal yata iyon.
‘That seems expensive.’

Hindi yata tama iyon.
‘That doesn’t seem right.’

Nagugutom yata ang bata.
‘The child seems to be hungry.’

(d)  Tuloy
Tuloy is used:
(1) to characterize one action or situation as resulting from another. In this use, it is

usually translatable by ‘as a result.’ Examples are:

Maingay kayo. Nagising tuloy ang bata.

“You were noisy. As a result, the baby was awakened.’
Naiwanan ako ng bus. Nahuli tuloy ako sa klase.

‘I missed my bus. As a result, | was late for class."

(2) to characterize an action as being logically or conveniently performed together
with another action. In this use, tufoy is often preceded by the enclitic particle na (cf.
§6.3), and is translatable by such expressions as ‘might as well...at the same time,”
‘while (I’m, etc.) at it, (I, etc.) might as well, etc. Examples are:

Magwalis ka sa bakuran. Magdilig ka (na) tuloy ng halaman,
‘Sweep the yard. You might as well water the plants at the same time.’

Tutungo ako sa kabayanan. Daraan (na) tuloy ako sa opisina.
‘I'm going downtown. While I’m at it, | might as well drop in at the office.’

(e) Sana
Sana is commonly used in the following ways:
(1) toexpress a hope: e.g.,

Masasaya sana sila.
‘L hope they’re happy.”

Nanalo sana ang kandidato ko.
‘I hope my candidate won.”

Manalo sana ang kandidato ko.
‘lL hope my candidate wins.”

(In this use, sana docs not occur with verbs in the contemplated aspect. When, as in the
last example, the hope relates to an event that has not yet occurred, an optative
construction — involving the basic form of the verb — is used (cf. §5.30). Note that in an
optative construction with sana (or kaya — cf. (a.1), above), the actor need not be
expressed by a personal pronoun.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 429

(2) with a verb in the contemplated aspect, to express an unrealized intention: e.g.,

Pupunta sana ako sa pulong kahapon pero nagbago ang isip ko.
‘Lhad intended to go to the meeting yesterday, but | changed my mind.”

Bibilhin sana nila ang bahay, pero kulang ang pera nila.
‘They would have bought the house, but they didn’t have enough money.”

(3) in the main clause of a sentence that includes a conditional clause (cf. §6.15),
in which case the main clause expresses a situation that has not occurred, as a result of
the condition’s being unfulfilled: ¢.g.,

Kung pumunta siya sa pulong, nakausap sana niya ang Alkalde.
‘If he had gone to the meeting, he could have gotten (o talk to the Mayor.’

(cf. Kung pumunta siya sa pulong, nakausap niya ang Alkalde.
‘If he went to the meeting, he got to talk to the Mayor.’)

§6.6. Positions of enclitic particles in sentences.

The position of any given enclitic particle in relation to other enclitics (particles or pronouns) within
a single enclitic sequence is presented in §6.2. The present section deals with the position of enclitic
particles in relation to non-enclitic sentence elements.

As was noted in §6.2, enclitic particles, with certain statable exceptions, follow the first word of the
structures of which they constitute an immediate part. From the point of view of the types of structures of
which they may constitute an immediate part, the enclitic particles may be divided into four groups, as
follows:

Group A: ba, kasi, kaya, man.

Group B: daw/raw, din/rin, ho, naman, nga, pala, po, sana, tuloy, yata.

Group C: lamangy/lang, muna.

Group D: na, pa.

Enclitic particles belonging to group A always constitute an immediate part of the initial component
of a sentence or a clause, whether this initial component is a predicate, a topic, or an adverbial. (A clause is
a part of a sentence that itself has the internal structure of a sentence.) Note, for example, the position of
ba, a group A particle, in the following sentences:

sasayaw ba sila ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi?
(Kung pakikiusapan ko sila,) sila bay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi?

bukas ba ng gabi ’ysasayaw sila ng pandanggo?
‘(If Lask them to,) will they dance a fandango tomorrow night?’

In each case, ba is an immediate part of the sentence — initial or clause — initial component, and follows its
first word. In one case, ba follows the first word of the predicate (sasayaw), in another, the inverted topic
(sila), in another, the first word of an inverted adverb (bukas). (For a discussion of inversion constructions,
cf. §7.2.) Regardless of the function of the initial component within the sentence or clause, a group A

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
430 CHAPTER 6

particle obligatorily constitutes an immediate part of it, and normally follows its first word. (More
precisely, the particle follows the first word other than a non-pre-enclitic — cf. below and §3.29. Thus,
within the initial adverb bukas ng gabi ‘tomorrow night,’ bukas may, in most cases, optionally be treated as
a non-pre-nclitic, in which case, since ng is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic, gabi serves as the pre-enclitic
word. Thus, also:

Bukas ng gabi ba’y sasayaw sila ng pandanggo?)

Group B particles may occur in all the same sentence positions as group A particles, but may also
occur in a variety of other sentence positions. That is, group B particles may always constitute an
immediate part of the sentence—initial component, but need not do so in all cases. In a basic sentence, a
group B particle, like a group A particle, must normally constitute an immediate part of the predicate. Thus
the group B particle dinfrin must follow sasayaw in the following sentence:

Sasayaw din sila ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(The Tagalog sentence involves the same ambiguities as its English equivalent, and may mean: ‘They (as
well as someone else) will dance ...° ‘They will dance (as well as do something else) . . . * ‘They will dance
a fandango (as well as something else)...” or ‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night (as well as at
some other time).”) When, however, a group B particle occurs in one of certain types of derived sentences
(or clauses with the internal structure of derived sentences of these types), it may constitute an immediate
part of some non-sentence—initial (or non-clause—initial) component. The types of non-sentence—initial
components of which group B particles most frequently constitute an immediate part are: inverted
predicates after ay or pause (cf. §7.2) and nominalized verbals.

Examples of sentences in which a group B enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part of an
inverted predicate are:

Sila’y sasayaw din ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(cf. Sila rin ay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night.’)

Bukas ng gabi’y sasayaw din sila ng pandanggo.
‘They will dance a fandango tomorrow night too.”

(cf. Bukas din ng gabi’y
sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
Bukas ng gabi rin ay
‘Tomorrow night too they will dance a fandango.’)

(As may be observed by comparing the translations of the sentences in which dinjrin constitutes an
immediate part of the inverted predicate with those in which it constitutes an immediate part of the
sentence—initial component, the relative flexibility of group B particles in sentences involving inversion
may be used to resolve, or partly resolve, ambiguities that are unavoidable in basic sentences.)

An example of a sentence in which a group B enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part of a

nominalized verbal is:

Sila ang sasayaw din ng pandanggo.
‘They are the ones who will dance a fandango too.’

(cf. Sila rin ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
‘They are also the ones who will dance a fandango.’)

(Group B particles may also constitute an immediate part of non-initial sentence—components of certain
other types: e.g., some kinds of adverbial phrases, as in:

Ito ang binili ko para rin sa iyo.
‘This is the one J bought for you too.")

The group C particles, Jamangflang and muna, are similar to the group B particles in the range of
structures of which they may constitute an immediate part. The major difference between the two classes is
that the group C particles cannot normally constitute an immediate part of a sentence—initial (or
clause—initial) adverbial followed by ay or pause. Thus, there is no:

lamang
*Bukas ng gabi ay sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
muna
but only:
{ Jamang
Bukas ng gabi ay sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.
l muna

just )
‘They will | dance a fandango tomorrow night.’
| first {

Group C particles may, however, constitute an immediate part of an inverted topic before ay or pause, or of
an inverted predicate after ay or pause. Thus:

lamang
Sila ay sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
muna

or:

{ lamang
Sila’y sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.

{mn

just
‘They will | dance a fandango tomorrow night.”
first

And they may constitute an immediate part of a non-initial nominalized verbal, etc.:

lamang
Sila ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
muna

j just

‘They’re the ones who will
l first

dance a fandango.’

The group D particles na and pa are also similar to group B particles in the range of structures of
which they may constitute an immediate part. But group D particles cannot normally constitute an

432 CHAPTER 6

immediate part of cither a topic or an adverbial followed by ay or pause. Thus there are no such sentences
as:

na’y
*Sila { sasayaw ng pandanggo bukas ng gabi.
3)
na
*Bukas { ng gabi’y sasayaw sila ng pandanggo.

Like group B and group C particles (and unlike group A particles), na and pa may, however, constitute an
immediate part of a non-initial nominalized verbal, etc.:

na
Sila ang sasayaw ng pandanggo.
pa
now dance
‘They’re the ones who will a fandango.”

go on dancing

(Na and pa show certain peculiarities with respect to the treatment of some sentence—initial or
clause—initial words as non-pre-enclitics. Specifically, certain words that are optionally non-pre-enclitic
with respect to the other enclitic particles —e.g., bakit ‘why,’ dahil ‘because’ halos ‘almost — are
obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to na and pa. Thus either:

ba
Bakit din hindi nagpahinga ang bata?
muna
or:
ba
Bakit hindi tin nagpahinga ang bata?

(mf
) isn’t the child resting any more?
Why

There is no:
{ na
*Bakit hindi nagpapahinga ang bata?)
(m

As was stated in §3.29, enclitics do not always follow the first word of a construction of which they
constitute an immediate part. The word that the enclitics follow (the PRE-ENCLITIC WORD hereafter, P)
is in some cases preceded by one or more NON-PRE-ENCLITICS (hereafter, N). Certain sentence elements
never function as P, and may be called OBLIGATORY NON-PRE-ENCLITICS; other function cither as N
or as P, and may be called OPTIONAL NON-PRE-ENCLITICS.

An inventory of sentence elements that function as N (either obligatorily or optionally) with respect
to enclitic pronouns is presented in §3.29. In general, these same elements function as N with respect to
enclitic particles. There are, however, certain differences in the lists of elements that serve as N with respect
to the two types of enclitic words. These differences are of the following kinds:

(1) Certain elements that are obligatorily N with respect to enclitic pronouns are never N with
respect to enclitic particles: viz., adverbs of which the enclitic particle constitutes an immediate part, and
which are followed by pause or by the inversion marker ay. Thus:

Bukas ba’y aalis siya?
‘Will he leave tomorrow?’

Bukas ba, aalis siya?
‘Is it tomorrow that he’s leaving?’
(cf. §3.29, inventory, subsection I.C.)

(2) Certain elements that are obligatorily N with respect to enclitic pronouns are optionally N with

respect to enclitic particles. These elements include:
(a) The adverb halos ‘almost’ (cf. §3.29, inventory, subsection 1.4.7). Thus:

{ nagkasakit daw
Halos siya.
| daw nagkasakit

‘They say he almost got sick.’

(b) The subordinating conjunctions bukod ‘besides,’ (imag )buhat ‘since,’ dahil ‘because,’ dangan ‘were

434 CHAPTER 6

it not that,’ maliban ‘unless,’ (mag }nula ‘since,’ noon ‘when,’ sa sandali ‘the moment that’ and (kung) sakali
‘in case,’ (subsection 1.A.10). Some examples are;

( may sakit po
Dahil siya, hindi siya makakarating.
l po may sakit

“Because he’s sick, sir, he won’t be able to come.’

sandali bang umalis )
Sa siya, sasabihan kita?
sandaling umalis ba

‘The moment that he leaves, shall I tell you?’

sakali bang makita mo

(Kung) siya, iimbitahin mo siya?
sakaling makita mo

‘In case you see him, will you invite him?’

(c) Non-final components of coordinate phrases (subsection 1.B.5). Thus:

Mabuti, malakas, at masaya daw
Mabuti, malakas daw, at masaya siya.
Mabuti daw, malakas, at masaya j

‘They say he’s well, strong, and happy.’

(d) Non-final components of adverbial phrases and directional complements that are not followed by
the linker na/-ng (subsection I.B.6). Thus:

ng gabi ba
Bukas siya aalis?
ba ng gabi
‘Is it tomorrow night that he’s leaving?
bahay sa probinsya ba
Sa siya pupunta?
bahay ba sa probinsya

‘Is it the house in the provinces that he’s going to?’

(3) Certain construction—initial elements are obligatorily N with enclitic particles, but do not occur
as initial elements of constructions of which enclitic pronouns constitute an immediate part: viz., non-final
components of addresses (cf. §4.4, subsection (1)), dates that involve English numbers (cf. §4.4,
subsection (2)), and expressions of percentage (cf. §4.4, subsection (4.c)): e.g.,

Dos
daang Medel po iyon.
Two

‘That's 2 Medel Street, sir.’

July third ba ngayon?
“Is today July third?’

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 435

Anim na
porsyento daw ang buwis.
Seis

‘They say the tax is six per cent.’

(Cf. (4.a), below, for the treatment of dates that involve Spanish or Tagalog numbers.)

(4) Certain construction—initial elements are optionally N with enclitic particles, but do not occur as
initial elements of constructions of which enclitic pronouns constitute an immediate part. These elements
include:

(a) Non-final componnents of dates that involve Spanish or Tagalog numbers (cf. §4.4, subsection

(2)).

ng Hulyo ba
A-tres
ba ng Hulyo
ngayon?
{ ng Hulyo ba
Ikatlo
ba ng Hulyo
‘Is today July third?’

(b) The reservational—phrase, partisanship—phrase, and purpose—phrase marker para (cf. §4.20,
subsections (1), (2), and (3)): e.g.,

sa iyo ba
Pasa ito?
ba sa iyo
“Is this for you?’
kay Makapagal ba
Para si Ernesto?
ba kay Makapagal
‘Is Emesto for Makapagal?’
{ sa pagluluto ba
Para iyan?
| ba sa pagluluto
‘Is that for cooking?’

(c) The referential—phrase maskers tungkol, hinggil, and nauukol (§4.20, subsection (5)): e.g.,

Tungkol
{ sa giyera ba

Hinggil ang kuwento?
| ba sa giyera

Nauukol

‘Is the story about war?’

With the above exceptions, the inventory of non-pre-enclitic elements presented in §3.29 generally applies
to enclitic particles as well as to enclitic pronouns.

436 CHAPTER 6

§6.7. Movable adverbs: introduction.

A moveable adverb is an adverb that, in general, has no fixed word—order relation to other sentence
elements. In a basic sentence a movable adverb may occur between components of the predicate, after the
predicate, or after the topic. The meaning of the sentence is not affected by changing the position of the

movable adverb. Thus the following four sentences, which differ from one another in the placement of the
movable adverb kahapon ‘yesterday,’ are identical in meaning:

Sumulat kahapon ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kahapon kay Maria si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kay Maria kahapon si Juan.
Sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan kahapon.
‘Juan wrote a letter to Maria yesterday.”

Movable adverbs may also occur at the beginning of a sentence or clause in the various inversion
constructions described in §7.2. The placement of a movable adverb at the beginning of a sentence or
clause usually results in a sentence that differs in meaning or in stylistic level from the same sentence with a
non-initial adverb. Thus:

Kahapon ay sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
‘Juan wrote a letter to Maria yesterday.’ (formal style)

Kahapon, sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
“Yesterday, Juan wrote a letter to Maria.”
(Possible implication: ‘Today, he will do something else.”)

Kahapon sumulat ng liham kay Maria si Juan.
‘It was yesterday that Juan wrote a letter to Maria.”

There is, however, one type of inversion construction — non-emphatic adverb inversion — in which the
initial placement of the adverb involves no change of meaning. (Only certain types of adverb — e.g., manner

adverbs (cf. §6.10) — occur in this inversion construction.) In non-emphatic adverb inversion, the adverb is
linked to the rest of the sentence by the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11). An example is:

Mabilis na naglakad si Pedro.
“Pedro walked quickly.’

(cf. Naglakad si Pedro nang mabilis.
‘Pedro walked quickly.’)

When an adverb occurs in initia) position, there are, in certain specifiable cases, obligatory changes in
the shape of the adverb itself. Specifically, if the adverb in non-initial position would be introduced by the
marker nang or the linker na/-ng this introductory element is deleted before the initial adverb. (The marker
spelled nang is phonemically identical with the marker spelled ng: both spellings represent /nan/. The
spelling nang is conventionally used for the marker at the beginning of a time adverb (cf. §6.8), a manner

adverb (§6.10), a measurement adverb (§6.11, subsection (3)), or a time clause (§ 6.16). the spelling ng is
conventionally used in most other cases.) Thus the nang that introduces the time adverb in:

Aalis tayo nang ala-una.
“We'll leave at one o'clock.’

is absent in:

Ala-una, aalis tayo.
“At one o’clock, we'll leave.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 437

Similarly, the linker that introduces the manner adverb in:

Umalis na bigla ang bisita.
‘The guest left suddenly.’

is absent in:

Biglang umalis ang bisita.
‘The guest suddenly left.’

(The deletion of introductory nang or na/-ng also applies to cases in which the adverb immediately follows
the inversion marker ay. Thus:

Tayo ay ala-una aalis.
‘It’s at one o’clock that we'll leave.’ (formal style)

Ang bisita ay biglang umalis.
‘The visitor suddenly left.’ (formal style)

Such constructions are themselves inversions of inversions: i.e., ay inversions of sentences that themselves
involve adverb inversion. Thus Tayo ay ala-una aalis is an ay inversion of:

Ala-una tayo aalis.
‘It’s at one o’clock that we'll leave.’

and Ang bisita ay biglang umalis is an ay inversion of:

Biglang umalis ang bisita.
‘The guest suddenly left.’ (formal style))

The various classes of movable adverbs are presented in subsequent sections as follows: TIME

ADVERBS in §6.8; LOCATIVE ADVERBS in §6.9; MANNER ADVERBS in §6.10; other movable
adverbs in §6.11.

§6.8. Time adverbs.

Adverbs expressing time may be divided into the following classes: (1) MARKED TIME ADVERBS;
(2) UNMARKED TIME ADVERBS; (3) TIME GERUND CONSTRUCTIONS. These classes are presented
below in the listed order. Then there is a discussion of: (4) EXPANSIONS OF TIME ADVERBS; and (5)
TIME ADVERBS AS PSEUDO-PREDICATES.

(1) MARKED TIME ADVERBS. A marked time adverb is introduced by one of the following
markers — (a) nang, (b) sa, (c) noon plus the linker na/-ng, (d) Aung, (ka)pag, tuwi + naj-ng, (e) buhat,
mula, umpisa, (f) hanggang — or by (g) the linker na/-ng.

(a) Nang introduces time adverbs of two types: POINT-TIME ADVERBS (adverbs that refer to a
single point in time or to a single delimited period of time) and FREQUENCY ADVERBS (see below).
Point—time adverbs introduced by nang are tenscless: that is, they may be used to refer to a point or
period of time that is past, present, or future: e.g.,

magtatrabaho
Bakit siya nagtatrabaho nang Linggo?
nagtrabaho

{ is he going to work
is he working on (a) Sunday?”
did he work

‘Why

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
438 CHAPTER 6

In this respect, point—time adverbs introduced by nang differ from certain point—time adverbs discussed
under (b) and (c) below.

The nang of a point-Time adverb may be followed by any of various words and phrases that express
points in time or periods of time: e.g., an expression of clock time (cf. §4.4, subsection (6)); makalampas
ng or pasado plus an expression of clock time; a date (cf. §4.4, subsection (2)); the name of a part of the
day (e.g., umaga ‘morning,’ hapon ‘afternoon,’ gabi ‘night’); the name of a day of the week; the name of a
month, etc. (The names of the days of the week are, in order from Monday through Sunday: Lunes,
Martes, Miyerkoles, Huwebes, Biyernes, Sabado, Linggo. The names of the months are, in order from
January through December: Enero, Pebrero, Maso, Abril, Mayo, Hunyo, Hulyo, Agosto, Setyembre,

Oktubre, Nobyembre, Disyembre; Eng)ish names for months are also occasionally used.)
Phrases consisting of mang plus an expression of clock time are translated by English ‘at’ phrases;

those consisting of nang plus a date are translated by English ‘on’ phrases: e.g.,

nang ala-una ‘at one o’clock’
Nang a-primero ng Encro ‘on the first of January’

Phrases consisting of nang makalampas ng or nang pasado plus an expression of clock time are
translated by English phrases introduced by ‘after,’ thus:

| { makalampas ng |
nang ala-una ‘after one o'clock’ |
. | pasado

Phrases in which nang is followed by the name of a part of the day involve a meaning of |

indefiniteness. The phrase nang umaga, for example, is closer in meaning to English ‘some moming’ or ‘of a

morning’ than it is to ‘in the morning.’ (The latter meaning is expressed by a saphrase — see (b), below.)

Phrases in which nang is followed by the name of a day of the week or of a month also involve a

| meaning of indefiniteness. Nang Lunes may, for example, be equivalent to English ‘on a Monday’ (or to ‘on

: Monday’ when this is used with an indefinite meaning), while nang Enero may be equivalent to English ‘one
| January’ (or to ‘in January’ when this is used with an indefinite meaning).

There is a group of nang point-time phrases in which nang is followed by buong (buo ‘whole’ plus the
linker na/-ng) plus a word that designates a period of time. These phrases are equivalent to English time |

phrases that begin with ‘all’: e.g., nang buong umaga ‘all morning,’ nang buong maghapon ‘all day (from
sunrise to sunset),’ nang buong magdamag ‘all night (from sunset to sunrise),’ nang buong linggo ‘all week,’
nang buong taon ‘all year.’ (In the case of the phrases ending in maghapon and magdamag, buong is
redundant, since nang maghapon and nang magdamag themselves mean ‘all day’ and ‘all night’ respectively.)
Nang is optionally deletable before buong in a time phrase. Thus:

j nang buong umaga.
Natulog sila

‘They slept all morning.”

| (In the case of phrases ending in maghapon and magdamag, nang is optionally deletable whether or not the
phrase also includes buong. Thus:

buong umaga. |
nang (buong) magdamag.
Natulog sila
(buong) magdamag. !

‘They slept all night.’)

Nang frequency adverbs consist of nang plus one of the following: madalas ‘often’; minsan-minsan
‘sometimes’; paminsan-minsan ‘occasionally’; a cardinal number plus the linker na/-ng plus beses or ulit

 
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 439

(both of which mean “times’); a frequentative number (cf 845. subsection (d} plus, optionally, ihe linker
naj-ng plus beses or ulit. Examples are:

madalas.

minsan-minsan.
Dumalaw siya sa kanila nang paminsan-minsan.

dalawang beses/ulit.

makaapat (na beses/ulit).

often.’

sometimes.”
He visited them occasionally.’

twice.’

four times.’

(Madalas, minsan-minsan and paminsan-minsan may be preceded by the linker na/-ng—see (g),
below — instead of nang, without change of meaning. Frequency adverbs formed with cardinal numbers and
those formed with frequentative numbers are identical in meaning. Thus ‘twice’ may be either nang
dalawang beses/ulit or nang makalawa(ng beses/ulit) and ‘four times’ may be either nang apat na beses/ulit
or nang makaapat (na beses/ulit).)

As is noted in §6.7, nang never introduces an adverb in sentence~ initial or clause—initial position (or
after the inversion marker ay). Most nang point—time adverbs may occur initially in any of three types of
inversion constructions (cf. §7.2): ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic adverb inversion. Each
of these constructions involves deletion of nang. Compare:

Nagsimba si Maria nang alas otso.
‘Maria went to church at eight o'clock.’

and:

Alas otso’y nagsimba si Maria. )
Alas otso, nagsimba si Maria.
Alas otso nagsimba si Maria. j

‘Maria went to church at eight o'clock.’ (formal style) }
‘At eight o’clock, Maria went to church.”
“It was at eight o’clock that Maria went to church.’ j

Those nang point—time adverbs that include buong and/or one of the two words maghapon and magdamag,
as well as all nang frequency adverbs, may occur initially in any of four types of inversion
constructions: the three mentioned above, plus the non-emphatic adverb inversion construction. In the

latter construction, the Joss of initial nang is accompanied by the addition of the linker na/-ng after the
adverb: e.g,

Buong umagang
(Buong) maghapong
nilinis ng Nanay ang bahay.
Makalawang
Apat na beses na

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
440 CHAPTER 6

all morning.”
all day.”
‘Mother cleaned the house
twice.
four times.”
(cf. Nilinis ng Nanay ang bahay nang buong umagi, etc.)

(b) Sa introduces two types of point—time adverbs: TENSELESS POINT-TIME ADVERBS, and
FUTURE POINT-TIME ADVERBS. In the tenseless adverbs, sa is followed by the name of a part of the
day, by certain formations involving the prefix k(inja- together with the suffix -an, or by one of certain
constructions involving nouns that designate periods of time: ¢.g., araw ‘day,’ linggo ‘week,’ buwan
‘month.’ A phrase consisting of sa plus the name of a part of the day involves a meaning of definiteness. In
this respect it differs from a phrase consisting of nang plus the name of a part of the day. Compare the
translations of the following sentences:

Dumating kami roon sa umaga.
‘We arrived there in the morning.”

Dumating kami roon nang umaga.
‘We arrived there of a morning.’

The k(inja-... -an formations that occur in tenseless sa phrases have as bases the name of a past of
the day, the name of a day of the week, or bukas ‘tomorrow.’ (Some speakers use only the full form of the
prefix, kina-; others use either Kina- or ka-. The final vowel of the prefix shows optional length.
Thus: /kina(‘)/, /ka(-)/. If the independent form of the base has an inherently long penultimate vowel, the
vowel Iength is normally shifted to the following syllable in the kfinja-...-an formations.
Thus: kfinJabukasan /k(in)a(:)ouka‘san/ — cf. bukas /bukas/. Additionally, there is a replacement of /e/
by /i/ and /of by /u/ in the syllable receiving the vowel length; thus: k/injalunisan {k(in)a(-)luni-sanf (cf.
Lunes flu:nes/), kinahapunan {k(in)a(-)hapu‘nan/ (cf. hapon /ha‘pon/). The base Biyernes /bye'mes/,
however, does not undergo length shift’ in the Afinja-...-an formation, thus k/injabyernesan
/k(in)a(-)bye"rnesan/ (cf. Byernes /bye-rnes/). Bases without inherently long vowels and those with
inherently long vowels in syllables preceding the penultimate syllable undergo no change in the
kfinja-...-an formations. Thus: k(in jagabihan /{k(in)a(:)gabihan/ (cf. gabi /gabih/): k(in Jamiyerkolesan
/k(in)a(‘)miye’rkolesan/ (cf. Miyerkoles /miye*rkoles/).) A phrase consisting of sa plus a Kfontja-... -an
formation is equivalent to an English phrase introduced by ‘(on) the following’: ¢.g., sa kinagabihan ‘(on)
the following night,” sa kinabukasan ‘(on) the following day.” (The same meaning may be expressed by a
kfin}a-. . . -an formation without a preceding sa: cf. subsection (2), below.)

Some examples of tenseless sa phrases involving terms for periods of time are: sa araw ng piyesta ‘on
the day of the fiesta,’ sa ikalawang linggo ‘in the second week,’ sa buwan ng Enero ‘in the month of
January,’ sa loob ng ilang taon ‘within a few years,’ sa fag-ulan ‘in the rainy season.” (Note that while ‘in the
month of January’ is expressed by a sa phrase, ‘in January’ with a tenseless meaning must be expressed by a
nang phrase — see (a), above. As is explained immediately below, a phrase consisting of sa plus the name of
a month has a future meaning.)

In the future point—time adverbs, sa may be followed by any of the following: a date, the name of a
day of the week, the name of a month, makalawa ‘the second day from today,’ or a modification

construction consisting of (1) the cardinal number ésa ‘one,’ the linker na/-ng, and a noun that designates a
period of time or (2) one of the two contemplated—aspect verb forms susunod ‘will follow’ and darating

‘will come,’ the linker na/-ng, and a noun that designates a period of time. In the case of the constructions
with susunod and darating, the marker sa may be followed by mga to give a plural meaning to the
noun — see the last example in the list below. Future point—time adverbs introduced by sa are often

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS “1

translatable by English phrases with ‘next,’ or by phrases with ‘on’ or ‘in’ where the latter have a future
meaning. Some examples are:

( ‘next January first”
sa a-primero ng Enero

l ‘on the first of (next) January’

{ ‘next Monday’

sa Lunes
| “on Monday (next)’
‘next January’
sa Enero

sa makalawa ‘the day after tomorrow’

( ‘next week’
sa isang linggo

| ‘in one week (from now)’

susunod ‘next month’
sa (mga) { na buwan ‘in the month(s)
| following this one”
darating

‘in the coming
month(s)’

(To express the equivalent of ‘in one week,” ‘in four years,’ etc., with a tenseless meaning, Tagalog uses a
phrase introduced by sa loob ng, literally ‘within.’ Thus:

j isang linggo.
Tinapos niya ang trabaho sa loob ng

| apat na taon.

one week.’
‘He finished the job (with)in
four years.’

There is no:

isang linggo.
*Tinapos niya ang trabaho sa
apat na taon.

(c) Noong (which is analyzable as the ng form of the deictic pronoun ivon (cf. §3.4) plus the linker
-ng) introduces PAST POINT-TIME ADVERBS; it may be followed by most of the words and phrases that
occur after sa in future point—time phrases (see (b), above), except that in modification constructions
involving verbs, the perfective—aspect verb nakaraan ‘passed,’ rather than susunod or darating occurs.
Noong phrases are often translatable by English phrases with ‘last’ or ‘ago,’ or by phrases with ‘on," ‘in,’ or
‘during’ where the latter have a past meaning. Some examples are:

‘last January first’
noong a-primero ng Enero
‘on the first of (last) January’

noong isang linggo

Noong may also be followed by panahon ‘time’ plus a ng phrase, to express the equivalent of English
phrases with ‘during’ or ‘at the time of,’ where these have past reference: e.g.,

“Il was working in Manila World War II.

at the time of {

(d) Kung, (ka}pag, and tuwing are all used to introduce RECURRENT-TIME ADVERBS (adverbs
that express a number of points in time or periods of time treated as recurrences of the same point or
period in systems of time measurement). They may be followed by various words and phrases that express
points of time or periods of time: expressions of clock time, dates, names of parts of the day, etc., Kung
and (ka /pag (kapag alternates freely with pag) are identical in meaning in time adverbs. (Both words are also
used to introduce time clauses — cf. §6.15; in this use, the words have overlapping, rather than identical,
meanings.) Kung is, however, the more commonly used time-phrase marker in educated Manila Tagalog. In
recurrent time adverbs kung and (kaj/pag mean literally ‘when.’ Their common English equivalents
sometimes involve pluralization — e.g., kKung/(ka}pag umaga ‘mornings (i.e., when it’s morning),’ Aung
Linggo ‘(on) Sundays {i.e., when it’s Sunday)’ — but are sometimes indistinguishable from point—time
adverbs. Thus ‘in August’ in the sense of ‘when it’s August’ is translatable by kung/(kaJpag Agosto, but in
other senses has different English equivalents (see (a), (b), and (c), above). Kung (but never (ka)pag) also
occurs in the frequency adverb kung minsan ‘sometimes.’

Tuwing phrases are equivalent to English time phrases with ‘every’: e.g., fuwing umaga ‘every
morning,’ tuwing Linggo ‘every Sunday,’ tuwing Agosto ‘every August.’ The noun faon ‘year’ never occurs
after tuwing, and the nouns oras ‘hour’ and buwan ‘month’ occur after tuwing only when they are followed
by ng phrases of specification (cf. §3.28), thus: wing oras ng panaghalian ‘every dinner time’, but never
simply *tuwing oras; and tuwing buwan ng Agosto ‘every August’ (literally, ‘every month of August’), but
never simply *tuwing buwan. The English phrases ‘every year,’ ‘every hour’, and ‘every month’ therefore
lack Tagalog equivalents in the form of phrases marked by tuwing. (For the equivalents of these phrases, see
(2) below.) (There are two synonymous time adverbs used primarily in literature — fewina and sa
tuwi-tuwina ‘always’ — that may be regarded as irregular sewing phrases.)

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 443

(e) Buhat, mula (or its less common variant simula), and umpisa are more or less synonymous as
markers of time adverbs; they are equivalent to English ‘since’ or ‘from... on.’ Buhat/mulafumpisa may
precede any of the following: expressions of clock time (optionally preceded by nang or sa — sce below);
future point—time phrases introdued by sa (cf. (b), above); past point—time phrases introduced by noong
(cf. (c), above); the various point-time words and phrases dealt with under (2) and (4), below (¢.g., Kahapon
“yesterday,” mamayang hapon “this (coming) afternoon’).

The nang that obligatorily precedes an expression of clock time in a tenseless point—time adverb (cf.
(a), above) is optional after buhat, mula or umpisa. Thus:

Mag-aaral
Nag-aaral sila buhat/mula/umpisa (nang) alas otso.
Nag-aral
will study
‘They study from eight o’clock on.’
studied

For some speakers, buhat sa, mula sa and umpisa sa alternate freely with buhat nang, etc., before a
clock—time expression where the reference is to recurrent periods of time or to a time in the future. Thus,
also, for these speakers:

Mag-aaral

sila buhat/mula/umpisa sa alas otso.
Nap-aaral

Other examples of time adverbs introduced by buhat, mula, or umpisa ate: buhat noong isang buwan
‘since last month,’ mula sa Enero ‘from (next) January on,’ umpisa nang 1950 ‘since 1950,’ buhat kahapon
‘since yesterday,” mula mamayang hapon ‘from this (coming) afternoon on."

(f) Hanggang is equivalent to English ‘until’ or ‘(up) to.’ It occurs before essentially the same words
and phrases as buhat, mula, and umpisa (cf. (¢), above). Nang, however, never follows hanggang. If a
point-time phrase that would be introduced by mang in other contexts follows hanggang, nang is
obligatorily deleted in the case of adverbs referring to the past, or, in the case of adverbs referring to the
future, either deleted or replaced by sa. For example:

Tumira ako roon hanggang 1950.
‘I lived there until 1950.”

(cf. Tumira ako roon nang 1950.
‘I lived there in 1950.’)

Magtatrabaho siya hanggang (sa) Lunes.
‘He will work until Monday.’

(cf. Magtatrabaho siya sa Lunes.
‘He will work on Monday.’)

Some further examples of anggang phrases are: hanggang noong Enero ‘until last January,’ hangeang
bukas ‘until tomorrow,’ hanggang kaninang umaga ‘until this (past) morning.”

(g) The time adverbs that are, either optionally or obligatorily, introduced by the linker na/-ng (when
they occur in non-sentence-initial or non-clause—initial position) comprise a small list of frequency
adverbs. (Cf. §3.11 for a discussion of the linker na/-ng.) Words that occur in frequency adverbs introduced
by na/-ng include: minsan ‘once,’ minsan-minsan ‘sometimes, paminsan-minsan occasionally,’ (paHagi
‘always,’ and madalas ‘often.’ In the case of the three forms that include minsan, the linker is optionally
deletable; it also alternates freely with the marker nang — cf. (a), above. In the case of (pa Jlagi and madalas

Elements sous droits d'auteur
the linker is not deletable. Examples are:

minsan
{ Pedro(ng)
Nagbakasyon si minsan-minsan sa Baguio.
| Manuel (na)
paminsan-minsan
once
“Pedro
sometimes vacationed in Baguio.”
‘Manuel
occasionally
Pedrong ) ( madalas
Nagbabakasyon si sa Baguio.

l Manuel na { | palagi

“Pedro { often
vacations in Baguio.’
“Manuel l atways|

When the above adverbs occur in sentence-initial or clause—initial position (or after the
inversion—marker ay), there is no introductory linker (cf. §6.7): e.g.,

Minsan ay nagbakasyon sj Pedro roon.
‘Pedro once vacationed there.’ (formal style)

If the initial occurrence of the adverb involves non-emphatic adverb inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (4)), the
adverb is followed by the linker na/-ng: c.g.,

Minsang nagbakasyon si Pedro roon.
“Pedro once vacationed there.”

Palaging nagbabakasyon si Pedro roon.
‘Pedro always vacations there.”

(2) UNMARKED TIME ADVERBS. Unmarked time adverbs (i.e., time adverbs that, regardless of
sentence position, lack an introductory marker or linker) may be divided into point—time adverbs and
tecurrent—time adverbs.

Unmarked point—time adverbs include: kamakalawa ‘the day before yesterday,’ kKahapon ‘yesterday,’
kagabi ‘last night,’ ngayon ‘today, now,’ bukas ‘tomorrow,’ and the same K/inja-. . . -an formations that
occur in marked point-time adverbs introduced by sa (cf. subsection (1.b), above; the marked and
unmarked k/in}a-...-an adverbs are identical in meaning; the unmarked adverbs are the more common).
Also included are (ka Jagad ‘right away,” Kanina ‘earlier (in the day),’ mamaya ‘later (in the day),” sandali ‘a
while, a moment,” and sanda-sandali ‘for brief periods.’ (Some speakers use the form Kangina /kani:nah/
instead of, or in free alternation with kanina /kani:nah/.)

The unmarked point~time adverbs Kahapon, kanina, and ngayon occur with the duplicating prefix
dup (cf. §5.16) in formations that connote psychological briefness of time between the time expressed by
the adverb and the moment of speaking. These duplicated formations are obligatorily followed by the
enclitic particle la(mawng (cf. §6.4, subsection (d)), and occur only sentence-initially, in sentences that

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 448

involve ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic inversion (cf. §7.2). Examples of the duplicated
formations in sentences are:

Kaha-kahapon lang ay nandito siya.
‘He was here only yesterday.”

Kani-kanina lamang, masaya siya.
‘Only a while ago, he was happy.’

Ngayon-ngayon lamang natapos ang miting.
‘It’s just now that the meeting ended.’

(There is also a duplicated formation derived from mamaya — viz., maya-maya ‘in a little while,’ as in:

Aalis ako maya-maya.
‘T'll be leaving in a little while.’)

Unmarked recurrent—time adverbs, like recurrent—time adverbs introduced by fuwing (cf. (1.4),
above), are equivalent to English time adverbs that begin with ‘every’; they are formed by duplication of
certain words that express periods of time: e.g., hapon-hapon ‘every afternoon’ (cf. hapon ‘afternoon’).
Some further examples are: @raw-araw ‘every day,’ oras-oras ‘every hour,’ gabi-gabi ‘every night,’
linggo-linggo ‘every week,” buwan-buwun ‘every month, taon-taon ‘every year.’ (There is no *umaga-umaga,
‘every morning’ is expressible only by tuwing umaga.) Any inherently long vowels present in the underlying
time word are retained in both parts of the recurrent—time formation. Thus: fha:punha:pon/ (cf.
f{ha:pon/).

(3) TIME GERUND CONSTRUCTIONS. The formation of gerunds is presented in detail in $3.26.
As is noted in that section, there are two gerund formations corresponding to most actor—focus verbs: an
ASPECTLESS GERUND, which designates an action without indicating whether or not it is viewed as
completed, and a PERFECTIVE GERUND, which designates an action viewed as completed. Pag-alis
‘leaving’ and pag/ka)kaalis ‘having left’ are, for example, respectively the aspectless gerund and the
perfective gerund that correspond to umalis ‘leave.’

Both aspectless and perfective gerunds occur in time gerund constructions. The form of the aspectless
gerund is the same in time gerund constructions as in other contexts; the form of the perfective gerund is
modified in the following ways: (a) the duplicating prefix ka- (/ka/), which is optional in other contexts,
does not occur in time gerund constructions; and (b) the last vowel of the prefix pagka-, which is long in
other contexts, is generally short in time gerund constructions. Thus, for example, the perfective gerund
corresponding to umualis ‘leave,’ which has the form pag(ka)kaalis ({pagka‘‘alis} or /pagkaka‘‘alis/) in other
contexts, has the form pagkaalis /pagka’alis/ in time gerund constructions.

Time gerund constructions with aspectless gerunds are often equivalent to English constructions that
begin with ‘when’ or ‘upon’; those with perfective gerunds, to English constructions that begin with ‘when’
or ‘after.’ For example:

j ‘when he leaves/left’
pag-alis niya

| ‘upon his leaving”

frwhen he has/had left”
pagkaalis niya

(after he leaves/left’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
In time adverbs, as in other cases, the performer of the action expressed by the gerund is designated
either by a following ng phrase (ng plus an unmarked noun, ni(na) plus a personal noun, the ng form of a
deictic or personal pronoun) or by a preceding sa form of a personal pronoun plus the linker -g. Thus:

ng titser { the teacher}
pag-alis ni Maria “when ¢ Maria leaves/left*
noon | that one {

pag-alis niya
‘when he leaves/left”
kaniyang pag-alis

The gerunds may also be followed by any object and/or directional and/or secondary—actor complements
(cf. §2.11 and 5.12) taken by the actor—focus verbs to which they correspond: e.g.,

pag-alis niya roon
‘when he leaves/left there’

(cf. Umialis siya roon.
“He left there.’)

pagpapatigil niya ng kotse sa akin
‘when he has/had me stop the car’

(cf. Nagpatigil siya ng kotse sa akin.
‘He had me stop the car.’)

Some examples of the use of time gerund constructions in sentences are:

Makakatulog
Nakakatulog ang tatay pagsisimula ng opera.
Nakatulog
will fall begins.”
‘Father falls asleep when the opera begins.”
fell began.’

Pangingisda ni Juan, sumasama ang kapatid niya.
‘When Juan goes fishing, his brother goes along.’

Huhugasan ng katulong ang pinggan pagka(pag)walis niya ng sahig.
‘The maid will wash the dishes when she has swept the floor.’

The equivalent of an English construction beginning with ‘as soon as,’ ‘immediately upon,’ or
‘immediately after’ is expressed by a time gerund construction in which the gerund is repeated, with the
two occurrences of the gerund joined by the linker na/-ng: ¢.g.,

pag-alis na pag-alis niya
‘as soon as he leaves/left”
‘immediately upon his leaving”

pagkaalis na pagkaalis niya

‘as soon as he has/had left”
‘immediately after he leaves/left’

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 447

Some examples in sentences are:

\ pagdating na pagdating

Aalis ako nila.
pagkarating na pagkarating
{ arrive.”
‘I'll leave as soon as they
| have arrived.”

Paghinging paghingi
ee ko, ibinigay niya sa akin.

Pagkahinging pagkahingi

{ askea /

‘As soon as I
[naa asked {

for it, he gave it to me.”

(4) EXPANSIONS OF TIME ADVERBS. The names of the days of the week (which occur in various
marked time adverbs disussed under (1), above) and certain unmarked time adverbs (e.g., Kanina ‘earlier,’
mamaya ‘later,’ bukas ‘tomorrow,’ etc. — cf. (2), above) may be expanded by a phrase representing a part
of the day, or by a phrase that expresses clock time. After the names of the days of the week and of
unmarked time adverbs other than kanina, mamaya and ngayon, ang phrase is used: e.g.,

nang
sa Lunes
hapon
noong ng

_—_—

kahapon
bukas

‘on (a)
‘next Monday

afternoon’
‘last

at one o'clock’
‘yesterday
‘tomorrow

After kanina, mamaya, and ngayon, the linker -ng precedes the name of the part of the day or the
clock—time expression: ¢.g.,

kaninang

hapon
mamayang

ala-una
ngayong

‘earlier (in the day)

during the afternoon’
‘later (in the day)

at one o‘clock’
‘today

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
448 CHAPTER 6

(The English translations given above for the constructions with Kanina, mamaya, and ngayon are quite
literal. The more usual English equivalents of kaninang hapon, mamayang hapon, and ngayong hapon
would, in cach case, be ‘this afternoon.’ The Tagalog constructions are, however, not

interchangeable: Kaninang hapon refers to ‘this past afternoon’ and mamayang hapon to ‘this coming
afternoon,’ while ngayong hapon may refer to either of these as well as to ‘this current afternoon.”)

If both the name of a part of the day and a clock time expression are given, the usual order
is: clock--time expression plus name of part of day; the latter is expressed by a ng phrase (cf. §4.4,
subsection (6)): ¢.g.,

sa Lunes ng
bukas ng

ala-una ng hapon
ngayong \
‘next Monday

‘tomorrow at one o'clock in the afternoon’
“today {

(The reverse order — name of part of day plus clock time expression — is possible but rare. When this order
is used, ng precedes the clock—time expression: e.g., ngayong hapon ng ala-una.)

The addition of the particle mga /manah/ to a time adverb normally adds a meaning of
approximateness — equivalent to English ‘about’ or ‘around’ — to the meaning of the adverb itself. (The
approximative particle mga also occurs with cardinal numbers — cf. §4.4; the particle is homonymous with
the pluralizing particle mga discussed in § §3.9 and 4.11). As part of a marked time adverb, mga appears
immediately after the marker: e.g.,

nang mga ala-una ‘at about one o'clock’
sa mga isang linggo ‘in about one week (from now)’
noong mga Lunes ‘about last Monday’

As part of an unmarked time adverb, mga is initial: ¢.g.,
mga kamakalawa ‘about the day before yesterday’

To express the equivalent of an English ‘from ...to...” time expression, a phrase introduced by
hanggang (see (1.f), above) is added to a phrase introduced by buhat, mula, or umpisa (sce (1.¢)). Some
examples are:

buhat (nang) ala-una hanggang alas sais
‘from one o'clock to six o*clock’

mula noong isang buwan hanggang ngayon
‘from last month to today’

umpisa nang 1950 hanggang 1958
‘from 1950 to 1958”

(5) TIME ADVERBS AS PSEUDO-PREDICATES. All of the time adverbs presented above, with
the exception of the time gerund constructions, may occur in predicate position. The topic of a sentence
with a time adverb in predicate position must be one of the following: an unmarked noun that designates a
natural phenomenon (e.g., bagyo ‘storm, lindol ‘earthquake’) or an event or activity (e.g., handaan ‘party,’

 
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 449

trabaho ‘work’), a deictic pronoun (cf. §3.4), a gerund (cf. §3.26), or a nominalized verb base (cf. §3.27).
For example:

ang handaan.

iyon.
Kung Pasko
ang pagbibigyan ng regalo.
ang alis nila.
‘The party )
‘That is (i.e., takes place) at Christmastime.”
‘The exchanging of gifts {

‘It’s at Christmastime that they leave.’

(As is explained in §3,27, a construction involving a time adverb in predicate position opposite a
nominalized verb base alternates freely with a construction involving an emphatic initial adverb (cf. §7.2)
plus an inflected form of a verb, and the adverb carries the same emphatic meaning.)

Time adverbs occurring in predicate position are classified as PSEUDO-PREDICATES, rather than as
genuine predicates, for two reasons: (1) as modifiers in modification constructions (cf. §3.19), time
adverbs function differently from modifiers that are related to genuine predicates: specifically, the linker
naj}-ng is not used with time—adverb modifiers, and the modifier occurs in a fixed position after the head.
Compare, for example:

handaan kung Pasko ‘party at Christmastime’
and:
handaang masaya
“gay party”
masayang handaan

(2) sentences involving time adverbs in predicate position are often understood as implying a deleted verbal
predicate, often a form of mangyari ‘takes place, occur, happen’ or gawin ‘be done, be held’: thus Kung
Pasko ang pagbibigayan ng regalo is equivalent in meaning to Nangyayari kung Pasko ang pagbibigayan ng
regalo ‘The exchanging of gifts takes place at Christmastime,’ and Kung Pasko ang handaan is equivalent in
meaning to Ginagawa kung Pasko ang handaan ‘The party is held at Christmastime.’ (cf. §6.9 for examples
of the functioning of locative adverbs as pseudo—predicates.)

When a time adverb that would be introduced by nang or by the linker na/-ng in non-initial position is
used as a pscudo—predicate, the nang or na/-ng is deleted. Thus:

Ala-una
ang mga miting.
Minsan-minsan

{ at one o'clock.”
‘Mectings take place
l occasionally.”

cf. { Nangyayari nang ala-una
ang mga miting.
l Nangyayaring minsan-minsan j

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
450 CHAPTER 6

j at one o'clock.’
“Meetings take place
| occasionally.’

Some further examples of sentences involving time adverbs used as pseudo—predicates are:

Noong isang taon ang lindol.
‘The earthquake occurred last year.’

Buong linggo ang piyesta.
‘The fiesta lasts all week.’

Mamayang alas dos ng hapon ang komperensya.
‘The conference will be held at one o'clock this afternoon.’

§ 6.9. Locative adverbs.

Locative adverbs are sa phrases. They represent the place where the action expressed in a sentence
occurs, or where the condition expressed in it prevails. The sa phrases that commonly occur as locative
adverbs include the following: sa plus an unmarked noun; Kina plus a personal noun; sa plus the sa form of
a plural personal pronoun, the sa form of a deictic pronoun. Some examples are:

sa iskwela.
Kumakain
kina Ben.
Diyanitor siya
sa kanila.
May trabaho
toon.
at the school.’
eats

at Ben’s place.”
‘He is a janitor
at their place.’

has a job
there.’

A locative adverb consisting of sa plus an unmarked noun is usually translated by an English ‘at,’ ‘in,” or
‘on’ phrase; a locative adverb consisting of kina plus a personal noun is usually translated by ‘at ’s
(place)’; a locative adverb consisting of sa plus the sa form of a plural personal pronoun is usually translated
by a phrase of the shape ‘at our/your/their place’; the sa form of a deictic pronoun used as a locative adverb
is usually translated by ‘here’ (in the case of dine and dito) or ‘there’ (in the case of diyan and doon). (Sa
phrases of the shapekay plus a personal noun, or of the shape sa plus a singular personal pronoun rarely
occur as locative adverbs.)

In a sentence with a verbal predicate, a sa phrase is sometimes ambiguously interpretable as a locative
adverb or as a directional complement. The sentence Suemulat siya sa mesa is an example of this kind of
ambiguity: it may be interpreted as meaning ‘He wrote at the table,” in which case sa mesa is interpreted as
a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself), in which case sa mesa is
interpreted as a directional complement. (It may be noted that Sumulat siya sa mesa has two different
goal—focus counterparts, each of which is unambiguous: Pinagsulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote at the table’
and Sinulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself).’ The first of these goal—focus
constructions involves the locative—focus counterpart of sumulat (cf. $5.9 for a treatment of locative
focus), while the second involves its directional—focus counterpart.)

 

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 451

There are also cases in which a sa phrase may be ambiguously interpreted either as a locative adverb
or as a locative adjective phrase (cf. §4.19) modifying a noun. The sentence Mabait ang bata sa iskwela is an
example of this kind of ambiguity: it may mean ‘The child is well—behaved at school,’ in which case sa
iskwela is interpreted as a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘The child (who is) at school is well—behaved,’ in
which case sa iskwela is interpreted as a locative adjective phrase modifying bate. (In the latter
interpretation, bata sa iskwela represents an optional abbreviation of batang nasa iskwela ‘child (who is) at
school’ — cf. §3.14.)

Like the nasa of a locative adjective phrase, the sa of a locative adverb may be followed by a
positional phrase: a phrase consisting of a positional noun plus a ng phrase. (cf. §3.14 for a listing of
positional nouns.) A locative adverb that includes a positional phrase has the same English equivalent(s) as
the corresponding locative adjective phrase. Some examples are:

harap
labas
Nakita ko siya sa ng teatro.
likod
loob

in front of
outside
‘I saw him the theatre.’
in back of
inside

gitna
ibabaw
May kahon sa ng mesa.
ilalim
tabi

in the middle of
on top of

‘There’s a box the table.”
beneath

next to

A locative adverb in which sa is followed by may plus an unmarked noun, positional phrase, etc,
expresses approximate location: e.g.,

Nakita ko sila sa may (harap ng) teatro.
‘I saw them in the vicinity of (the front of) the theater.’

(Cf. $4.19 for the similar use of may in locative adjective phrases.)

Like time adverbs (cf. §6.8, subsection (5)), locative adverbs may occur as pseudo~predicates
Opposite certain types of nouns or nominalizations in topic position. (The topic types that occur opposite
pseudo—predicates as well as the nature of the pseudo—predicate construction itself, are discussed in detail
in §6.8, q.v.) Some examples are:

{ ang parada.
iyon.
ang pagmamartsa.

Sa Abenida Rizal raw

452 CHAPTER 6

( the parade
that is (i.e., takes place) on Rizal Avenue.’

‘They say

Dito ba ang dating ng tren?
‘Is it here that the train arrives?”

§6.10. Manner adverbs.

Manner adverbs characterize the way in which the action expressed by a verb — or by a formation
derived from a verb (e.g., a gerund — cf. §3.26) — is performed. Tagalog manner adverbs may be equivalent
to English adverbs ending in ‘-ly’—e.g., ‘loudly,’ ‘quickly’— or to various other English adverbial
expressions.

Manner adverbs may be divided into three classes, on the basis of whether, when they occur in
non-initial position, they are introduced by: (1) the marker nang: (2) the linker na/-ng; (3) cither the
marker nang or the linker na/-ng. (cf. §6.7 for a discussion of the marker nang, and §3.11 for a discussion
of the linker na/-ng.)

(1) Included in this class are constructions in which nang is followed by: (a) a member of a subclass
of unaffixed adjectives (cf. §4.2); (b) a member of a subclass of ma- adjectives (cf. §4.3); (c) a grouping
numeral (cf. §4.5, subsection (e)); (d) an adjective phrase expressing resemblance of one of the following
types: gaya plus a ng phrase; a contraction derived from gaya and the ng form of a deictic (i.e., ganire,
ganito, ganyon, or ganoon), or such a contraction plus a ka- adjective formation (cf. §4.18). (The unaffixed
adjectives and ma- adjectives that occur in manner adverbs are those whose meaning is compatible with
characterizing the way in which an action is performed. Most of these same adjectives — or their
bases — may occur in a ka- adjective formation (after ganire, etc.) within a manner adverb. As is noted in
§4.18, some speakers use the linker -ng before the ka- formation, while others do not.) Some examples are:

) Lumakad ang pari nang banayad (na banayad).
‘The priest walked at a (very) moderate pace.’
(an adjective within a manner adverb may be expanded in the usual ways — e.g., through the
use of an intensive construction, as in the above example.)

Binuksan ni Fred ang pintuan nang bigla.
‘Fred opencd the door suddenly.”

(b) Kailangan nating kumain nang mabilis.
“We must eat quickly.”

Bawal ang magsalita nang malakas dito.
‘Speaking loudly is forbidden here.”

(c)  Binilang niya ang mangga nang dala-dalawa.
‘He counted the mangoes by twos.’

Papasok tayo sa kuwarto nang isa-isa.
‘We'll enter the room one by one.’

(d) Kumanta ang mga bata nang gaya ng mga ruwisenyor.
‘The children sang like nightingales.’

Nakakapagod ang pagsayaw nang ganoon.
‘Dancing like that makes one tired.

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 453

Hindi ka dapat magmancho nang ganito(ng) kabilis.

{ this fast,’
‘You shouldn’t drive
l as fast as this one.’

(The ambiguity of constructions like ganito(ng) kabilis, noted in §4.18, is present in manner
adverbs that involve the constructions.)

(2) Included in this class are constructions in which the linker na/-ng is followed by: (a) an adjective
phrase expressing resemblance, consisting of parang (para plus the linker -ng) plus a nominal (cf. §4.18); (b)
the imperfective form of an actor—focus verb (cf. §5.21). Some examples are:

(a) Sumigaw si Manuel na parang luku-luko.
‘Manuel shouted like a madman.’

Lumalakad si Neneng parang mananayaw.
‘Nene walks like a dancer.’

(b) Bakit siya umalis na umiiyak?
“Why did she leave crying?”

Lumabas doong tumatakbo ang bata.
‘The child came running out of there.’

(3) Included in this class are constructions in which either the marker nang or the linker na/-ng is
followed by a pa- manner adjective (cf. §4.7). Some examples are:

{ nang }
Ang alimango’y lumalakad { patagilid.
na

‘The crab walks sideways.’

ako nang

Binati niya pangiti.
akong

‘He greeted me smilingly.’

Manner adverbs do not occur initially in ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic adverb
inversion, but do occur initially in non-emphatic adverb inversion, in which case they are linked to what
follows by the linker na/-ng (cf. §7.2, subsection (4)).

As is noted in §6.7, a nang or linker that introduces a non-initial adverb is dropped when the adverb
occurs in initial position. Some examples are:

Biglang binuksan ni Fred ang pintuan.
‘Fred opened the door suddenly.”

Gaya ng mga ruwisenyor na kumanta ang mga bata.
‘The children sang like nightingales.’

454 CHAPTER 6

§6.11. Other movable adverbs.

In addition to time adverbs, locative adverbs, and manner adverbs (cf. §§6.8, 6.9, and 6.10
respectively), Tagalog has movable adverbs of a number of other kinds. These adverbs are presented below
under the following headings: (1) adverbs with non-initial sa phrases; (2) sa... ng adverbs; (3) sang
Measurement adverbs; (4) miscellaneous movable adverbs.

(1) ADVERBS WITH NON-INITIAL sa PHRASES. Members of this class of adverbs consist of an
introductory word followed by a sa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun, nominalization, or sa-form personal
pronoun, kay or kina plus a personal noun; or a sa-form deictic pronoun.) The class includes: (a)
BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE, and other adverbs introduced by para; (b) CAUSATIVE ADVERBS; (c)
REFERENTIAL ADVERBS; (d) other adverbs with non-initial sa phrases.

(a) BENEFACTIVE, PURPOSE and other adverbs introduced by para. In both benefactive and
purpose adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by para. In benefactive adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase
is usually a noun or pronoun; in purpose adverbs, the nominal within the sa phrase is a gerund (cf. §3.26).
Both types of adverbs are normally translatable by English ‘for’ phrases, and both are similar in form and
meaning to certain adjective phrases (cf. §4.20, subsections (1) to (3)).

Benefactive adverbs may express either the meaning ‘for the benefit (or use) of ...° or ‘acting in
place of ...’. Thus the sentence:

Ginawa niya ang trabaho para sa iyo.
‘He did the work for you.”

is capable of being interpreted in either of two ways: ‘He did the work for your benefit’ or ‘He did the
work, acting in your place.’ And the sentence:

Bibilhin mo ba iyon para sa akin?
‘Will you buy that for me?’

may mean either ‘Will you buy that for my use?’ or ‘Will you buy that, acting in my place?’
The nominal within a benefactive adverb often corresponds to the topic of a benefactive—focus verb
(cf. §5.7). Some examples are:

{ Sumulat ka ng liham para sa skin}
Isulat mo ako ng liham.
“Write a letter for me.”

{ Nagluto siya ng adobo para sa mga bisita.
Ipinagluto niya ng adobo ang mga bisita.
‘She cooked adobo for the guests.”

Purpose adverbs express the meanings ‘for the purpose’ of ...°, ‘for use in. ..°, etc. Some examples
are:

Kunin mo ang perang ito para sa pag-aaral mo.
‘Take this money for your studies.”
(More literally: ‘for your studying’)

Bumili siya ng walis para sa paglilinis niya ng bahay.
‘She bought a broom to clean the house with.’

Both benefactive and purpose adverbs are sometimes ambiguously interpretable as modifying adjectival
phrases. (As is noted in §3.14, the linker na/-ng is optionally deletable before a modifying phrase
introduced by para.) Thus in the sentence:

Iniinit ng Nanay ang pagkain para kay Nene.
‘Mother is heating the food for Nene.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
tS SSS SSS SSS ST
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 455

The para sa phrase may be interpreted either as a benefactive adverb (in which case it means ‘for Nene’s
benefit’ or ‘acting in place of Nene’) or as an adjectival (in which case it means ‘which was for Nene’).
Similarly in:

Bumili ako ng alak para sa pagluluto.
‘I bought some wine for (the) cooking.’

the para sa phrase may be interpreted cither as a purpose adverb (in which case it means ‘in order to cook’)
or as an adjectival (in which case it means ‘which was for cooking’).

In addition to benefactive and purpose adverbs, para plus a sa phrase forms adverbs of various other
types, all of them equivalent to ‘for’ phrases in English. Some examples are:

Bumalik siya sa opisina para sa sulat.
‘He returned Co the office for the letter.’

Pumunta sila sa bayan para sa pista.
‘They went to town for the fiesta.’

Bumili ako ng karne para sa sopas.
‘I bought some meat for the soup.”

(b) CAUSATIVE ADVERBS. In causative adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by dahil. The adverbs
are translatable by English phrases introduced by ‘because of or ‘as a result of.’ Some examples are:

Pinili siya dahil sa kakayahan niya.
“He was chosen because of his ability."

Nagkahiwalay sila dahil sa kaniyang paglalasing.
‘They separated because of his drinking.”

The nominal within a causative adverb often corresponds to the topic of a causative—focus verb (cf. §5.8).
Some examples are:

{ Namatay siya dahil sa gutom. }
Ikinamatay niya ang gutom.
‘He died (as a result) of hunger.’

{ Nainis siya dahil doon.
Ikinainis niya iyon.
“He was annoyed because of that.’

In addition to nouns, pronouns, and nominalizations, the sa of a causative adverb may be followed by
certain formations consisting of ka- /ka‘/ plus a duplicating syllable plus a verb base. The formation of the
duplicating syllable follows the rules given for dup, in §3.7. Inherent length in the verb base is

retained: e¢.g., kalalakad /ka‘lala‘kad/ ‘walking too much’ (cf. Iumakad fluma‘kad/ ‘walk’). These
formations, which express a meaning of excessive performance of the activity denoted by the base, occur

only in causative adverbs, and do not occur as topics of causative—focus verbs. Some examples in sentences
are:

Napagod siya dahil sa kalalakad.
‘He got tired as a result of walking too much.’

Nagkasakit siya dahil sa kabibilad sa araw.
‘He became ill as a result of too much exposure to the sun.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
456 CHAPTER 6

The dahil of a causative adverb is optionally deletable before sa plus a Xa- formation of the type just
described. Thus, also:

Napagod siya sa kalalakad.
Nagkasakit siya sa kabibilad sa araw.

Dahil is also optionally deletable in some other cases. Namatay siya sa gutom, for example, is identical in
meaning with Namatay siya dahil sa gutom ‘He died (as a result) of hunger.” In still other cases, however,
dahil must be retained. Thus the dahil of Nagkahiwalay sila dahil sa kaniyang paglalasing. ‘They separated
because of his drinking’ is not deletable.

(In literature, the dahil of a causative adverb is sometimes replaced by sah, as in:

Nagpakamatay ang prinsesa sanhi sa kataksilan ng prinsipe.
‘The princess killed herself because of the prince’s faithlessness.”)

(c) REFERENTIAL ADVERBS. In referential adverbs, the sa phrase is preceded by tungkol, hinggil,
or ukol. (As in the case of referential adjective phrases — cf. §4.20, subsection (5) — rungkol is the most
common of the three in ordinary conversation.) The adverbs are normally translatable by English adverbs
introduced by ‘about,’ where ‘about’ connotes ‘on the subject of.’ Some examples are:

tungkol

Nagsinungaling siya hinggil sa mga gawain niya.
ukol

‘He lied about his activities.”

Nag-usap kami tungkol sa handaan.
“We talked about the party.”

The nominal within a referential adverb often corresponds to the topic of a referential—focus verb
(cf. §5.10). Some examples are:

{ Nagkwento siya tungkol sa evan}
Ikinuwento niya ang giyera.
‘He told a story about the war.’

{tassasons ako sa kaniya tungkol sa Amerika.
Itinanong ko sa kaniya ang Amerika.
‘Lasked him about America.’

(d) OTHER ADVERBS WITH NON-INITIAL sa PHRASES. Adverbs that consist of the words listed
below plus a sa phrase are normally equivalent to English adverbs introduced by the expressions shown to
their right:

alang-alang ‘for the sake of
alinsunod ‘in accordance with’
ayon ‘according to”
bukod ‘as well as, besides’

ClAmante ene Arnite Ain
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 457

buhat ‘from’
(ma)liban
(ma)tangi ‘except (for)

Examples in sentences follow:

Nagpakasakit siya alang-alang sa kaniyang pamilya.
‘He made a sacrifice for the sake of his family.’

Nagbabayad ako ng buwis alinsunod sa patakaran.
‘I pay taxes in accordance with the regulation.’

Uulan (daw) bukas, ayon sa diyaryo.
‘It’s going to rain tomorrow, according to the newspaper.”

(The enclitic particle daw/raw ‘it is said’ — cf. §6.4, subsection (e) — is frequently, but not obligatorily,
used in sentences that include adverbs introduced by ayon.)

Tumanggap siya ng medalya, bukod sa mga aklat.
‘He received a medal as well as the books.”

Maglakad tayo buhat dito.
‘Let’s walk from here.’

(Buhat also occurs in time adverbs — cf. §6.8, subsection (1.e).)

(ma)liban
Narito na ang lahat kay Jose.

(ma)tangi
‘Everyone is here now except Jose.”

(2) Sa...ng... ADVERBS.. These adverbs consist of sa, plus one of a limited list of words (see
below), plus a mg phrase (ng plus an unmarked noun or nominalization, ni or nina plus a personal noun, or
the ng form of a personal or deictic pronoun). Among the common sa... mg... adverbs are the following:

halip
sa ng ‘instead of, in place of
lugar
sa pag-iingat ng ‘in the care of”
sa pagtataguyod ng ‘in the interest of (supporting)’
sa pagtatanggol ng ‘in defense of

‘I'll do the cleaning instead of Tita.”

Iniwan ang bata sa pag-iingat ng kaniyang lola.
‘The child was left in the care of his grandmother.’

Magtulungan tayo sa pagtataguyod ng kandidato natin.
‘Let’s help one another in the interest of our candidate.”

Namatay sila sa pagtatanggol ng bayan.
‘They died in defense of the country.”

Nagtagumpay siya sa pamamagitan ng masikap na paggawa.
‘He succeeded by means of hard work,”

Inilagay niya ang Kalakal sa pamamahala ng kapatid niya.
‘He put the business under the supervision of his brother.’

Ipinagbili niya ang lupa niya sa payo ng kaibigan niya.
‘He sold his land on the advice of his friend.’

Nakapag-aral siya sa tulong ng pamilya niya.
‘He was able to go to school with the help of his family.’

(3) Nang MEASUREMENT ADVERBS.
Nang measurement adverbs consist of the marker nang plus an expression of measurement. Examples

are:

nang apat na yarda ‘four yards’
nang tatlong oras ‘three hours”
nang limang libra ‘five pounds’
nang malaki ‘alot’

Nang measurement adverbs occur with a limited set of intransitive -ur- verbs of ‘becoming’ (cf. §5.6,
class J). The verbs express measurable changes; the nang adverbs that occur with them express the extent of
the change. Examples in sentences are:

Lumaki siya nang tatlong pulgada.
‘He grew (i.e., became bigger by) three inches.’

Tumagal ang pista nang isang linggo.
‘The feast lasted (i.e., became long) one week.’

Bumigat na nang walang onsa ang sanggol.
‘The baby has already gained (i.e., become heavier by) eight ounces.”

Nang measurement adverbs correspond to predicates that occur opposite nominalized

measurement—focus verbs (cf. § 5.10).
(4) MISCELLANEOUS MOVABLE ADVERBS. Among the other common movable adverbs of
Tagalog may be noted the following: phrases consisting of bilang plus a nominal, equivalent to English

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 459

adverbs introduced by ‘as (a form of) or ‘by way of": the fixed phrases Aung ganoon ‘in that case,” sa
biglang/madaling sabi ‘in short,’ sa wakas ‘in the end’; the words halos ‘almost,’ marahil ‘probably,’ seguro
‘maybe,’ ulift} and muli ‘again.’ (Uli(t) and muli ate optionally preceded by the linker -ng- in non-initial
position.) Illustrative sentences follow:

Inilabas niya ang liham bilang katibayan.
‘He brought out the letter by way of proof.”

Ako mismo ang gagawa, kung ganoon.
‘T'll do it myself, in that case.”

biglang

Wala kang magagawa kundi umalis, sa sabi.
madaling

‘You have no choice but to leave, in short.”

Inihalal nila siyang presidente, sa wakas.
‘They elected him president, in the end.’

Namatay siya halos.
‘He almost died.’

Hindi sisipot marahil si Totoy.
‘Totoy probably won’t come.’

Mag-aaral siya seguro mamayang gabi.
‘Maybe he’ll study tonight.

uli(t).
Basahin mo(ng)

muli.
‘Read it again.’

§6.12. Initial adverbs.

Tagalog has a number of adverbs that always occur in sentence—initial or clause—initial position.
These adverbs may be divided into four classes. Members of classes (1), (2), and (3) are followed,
respectively, by: (1) a pause; (2) either a pause or the inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2); (3) the linker na/-ng
(cf. §3.11). Members of class (4) are immediately followed by the rest of the sentence or clause, with no
intervening pause, marker, or linker.

(1) The only member of this class is the rhetorical linker £, which expresses a sequential or logical
connection between the sentence it introduces and some preceding utterance or pre-existing situation. It is
often equivalent to English ‘and,’ ‘well,’ or ‘why.’ Some examples of its use are:

E, magkano naman ito?
‘And how much is this one?’

Napapagod ka? E, magpahinga ka.
You're tired? Well, get some rest.’

E, isip ko’y nasa iyo ang mga tiket.
‘Why, I thought you had the tickets.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
460 CHAPTER 6

(As is noted in $1.24, E takes a distinctive intonation pattern (pattern 1.4). See below for the use of E with
the class (4) initial adverb di.)
(2) Initial adverbs that may be followed either by a pause or by ay include:

alalaong baga ‘in other words’
kasi

‘the reason is...”
mangyari
gayon man ‘nevertheless’
samantala ‘meanwhile’

Some examples in sentences are:

baga,

Alalaong ayaw mong gawin.
baga’y

‘In other words, you don’t want to do it.”

Kasi,
Kasi ay.
(Hindi ako makakaalis.) may sakit ang anak ko.
Mangyari,
Mangyari ay.
“(I can't leave.) The reason is, my child is sick.’

man, )
(Lumang-luma na ang kotse.) Gayon bibilhin pa rin niya.

man ay f
(‘The car is already very old.) Nevertheless, he will (still) buy it.”

Samantala,

susuriin ko ito.
Samantala’y
‘Meanwhile, I'll examine this.”

(3) Initial adverbs followed by the linker na/-ng include:

baka sakali ‘perhaps’
(pam)bihira ‘seldom’
totoo ‘it’s true that’

Some examples are:

(Magtanong ka kay Juan). Baka sakaling alam niya ang sagot.
“Ask Juan. Perhaps he knows the answer.”

Pambihirang}
umulan dito.

Bihirang

‘It seldom rains here.”

Totoo raw na magiging kandidato siya.
‘They say it’s true that he will be a candidate.”

Elamonte cane droite diantenr

SSeS
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 461

(4) Initial adverbs that are immediately followed by the rest of the sentence include:

baka (expression of conjecture or anxiety)
di ‘then’
tila ‘it seems”

(Baka and tila are optionally non-pre-enclitic. Di is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic. Cf. §3.29.)
When it introduces a sentence with a nominal or adjectival predicate, or a predicate that includes an

aspect—marked verb form, baka expresses conjecture. Some examples are:

Baka magkaibigan sila.
“Maybe they’re friends.’

Baka mabuti iyon.
‘That might be good.’

Baka nabasag ang baso.
‘It’s possible that the glass got broken.’

Baka also occurs in a special construction in which it is followed by the basic form of a verb (cf. $2.8) used
as a predicate. This construction expresses anxiety on the part of the speaker about a possible undesired
occurrence. Some examples are:

Baka mabasag ang baso. ‘I’m afraid that the glass may get broken.’
Baka umulan bukas. ‘I’m afraid it may rain tomorrow.”

The adverb di (which is a different word from the negator di — cf. §7.13) is commonly preceded by
the class (1) initial adverb, E (see above): e.g.,

E. di gagawin ko agad.
“Well then, I'll do it right away.”

It may, however, occur without E: e.g.,

Di gagawin ko agad.
‘Then I'll do it right away.”

An example of the use of tila is:

Tila magkakaroon ng parti bukas.
‘It seems there’s going to be a party tomorrow.”

§ 6.13. Sentence—final particles.

Tagalog has four particles — a, e, ha, and o — which occur only in sentence—final position. All four
are conventionally written with a preceding comma, but only Aa and o form separate intonation phrases (cf.
§1.24, patterns 1.2 through 1.5); @ and e are always included in a single intonation phrase with what
precedes them (cf. §1.27, pattern [V.1).

A is used in sentences that express an event or situation that is contrary to expectation: either the
speaker's own expectation (in which case the sentence often includes the enclitic particle pala ~ cf. §6.5,
subsection (b)) or that of the person(s) addressed. A is often equivalent to an initial ‘but’ in English. Some

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
462

examples are:

Ayun (pala) sila, a!

(‘Oh,) but there they are!’

Maganda pala ito, a!
‘Oh, but this is pretty!”

Hindi na sila nakatira doon, a.
“But they don’t live there any more.”

CHAPTER 6

Ehas three main uses. Accompanying an explanation, it is equivalent to English ‘it’s because’ or ‘you
see’; accompanying a contradiction of something said by another speaker (in which case the sentence often
includes the enclitic particle nga — cf. §6.4, subsection (b.3)), it is equivalent to ‘on the contrary’, in other
cases (particularly in answer to questions), it expresses regret or sympathy, and may be equivalent to

‘unfortunately.’ Some examples are:

(Bakit hindi ka kumakain?)
“Why aren’t you eating?’

(Hindi ko nabili.)
(I couldn’t buy it.’)

(Matalino ka, hindi ba?)
(You're intelligent, aren’t you?’)
(Mayayaman ang mga Santos.)

(‘The Santoses are rich.”)

(Kumusta si Juan?)
(‘How is Juan?’)

(Nakabili ka na ba ng kotse?)
(‘Have you bought a car?’)

Busog pa ako, ¢.
‘It’s because I’m still full.’

Kulang ang pera ko, ¢.
‘I didn’t have enough money, you see.’

Ikaw (nga) ang matalino, ¢.
‘On the contrary, you’re the
intelligent one.’

Mahihirap (nga) sila, ¢.
‘On the contrary, they’re poor.’

May sakit siya, e.
*He’s sick, unfortunately.”

Hindi pa, e.
‘Not yet.”

Ha is used only in informal contexts, in utterances directed toward people with whom one uses the
second—person-singular pronoun (cf. §3.3). Ha may be added to a question, a command or request, or one
of several types of social formulas (cf. §7.22). In these uses, Aa expresses importunity. Examples are:

Aalis ka na ba, ha?

‘Well, are you leaving now?’ (Implication: ‘Do answer me.’)

Hintayin mo nga ako, ha?
‘Please wait for me, won’t you?”

Diyan ka na, ha?
‘See you later, huh?’

Salamat, ha?

‘Thank you.’ (Implication: ‘You'll accept my thanks, won’t you?’)

Sige na, ha?
‘Okay?’

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 463

(After a question or a request, fa always carries a rising intonation pattern (pattern 1.3, §1.24: /2t/); after
a command or social formula, it carries either this pattern or a sustained pattern (pattern 1.4, $1.24: /2>/).
When it carries the rising pattern, Aa may express different degrees of importunity, according to whether it
is spoken at normal speed or slowly, with the vowel dzawled. Mild importunity is expressed when ha is
spoken at normal speed, a greater degree of importunity when it is spoken slowly.)

Ha is also used to suggest sarcasm or a challenge to an assertion made by the person addressed. (In
these uses /ia carries either a falling intonation pattern (pattern 1.2: /2$/) or one of several sustained
patterns (patterns 1.4 and 1.5: {/2>/ and /1->/).) Examples are:

Marunong ka, ha?
‘You think you're smart, don’t you?”

Hindi ka ba papasok, ha?
‘So you're not going to school?’ (We'll just see about that!’)

O is used in informal situations either after a polite request that includes nga (cf. §5.29), in which
case it increases the urgency of the request, or to direct the attention of the person(s) addressed, in which
case it is equivalent to English ‘Look!’ (After a request, o carries a sustained intonation pattern (pattern
1.5: /1>/); as an attention director, it carries either this pattern or a rising pattern (pattern 1.3: /2t/).)
Examples are:

Tulungan mo nga ako, o.
‘Come on, help me, please.’

Ayusin mo nga ito, 0.
“How about fixing this, please.’

Ayun si Juan, o!
‘Look, there’s Juan!’

Basag ang baso, o.
‘Look, the glass is broken.’

§ 6.14. Adverbial clauses: introduction.

A clause is a part of a sentence that itself has essentially the same internal structure as a sentence. An
ADVERBIAL CLAUSE is a clause that occurs in the same sentence contexts as an adverbial, and that has a
similar semantic function. (For a presentation of other clause types that occur in Tagalog, cf. §§3.28
(nominal clauses), 7.19 (coordinate clauses), and 7.20 (explanatory AT clauses).)

Most Tagalog adverbial clauses are introduced by a SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTION, a word or
phrase whose function is to specify the precise adverbial relation of the clause they introduce to the rest of
the sentence. (Cf. §6.17, subsections (4) and (5), however, for a presentation of adverbial—clause types
that lack a subordinating conjunction, the adverbial relation being expressed, instead, by enclitic particles.)

A sentence that includes an adverbial clause may be called a COMPLEX SENTENCE. A complex
sentence always includes, in addition to the adverbial clause, a MAIN CLAUSE: a clause that is not
introduced by a subordinating conjunction, and that, unlike the adverbial clause, is capable of occurring
independently as a complete sentence. For example, in the complex sentence:

Pupunta siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng Tatay.
‘He will go to Manila if Father gives him permission.”

the main clause is Prpunta siya sa Maynila ‘he will go to Manila’ the subordinate clause, Kung papayagan

siya ng Tatay ‘if Father gives him permission.’ (In those few complex—sentence types that involve enclitic
particles rather than subordinating conjunctions, the distinction between the main clause and the adverbial

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
464 CHAPTER 6

clause is not always perfectly clear, since both clauses are usually marked by enclitic particles, and both
may in most cases occur independently.)
An adverbial clause may occur cither before or after the main clause. Thus, also:

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.”

If the adverbial clause precedes the main clause, it normally constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is
followed by a pause (represented in conventional writing by a comma). A sentence with an initial adverbial
clause followed by a pause involves contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (2)), and, potentially at least,
carries contrastive meaning. The above sentence, for example, might occur in a context such as:

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
Kung hindi siya papayagan, mamamalagi siya rito.

‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.

‘If he isn’t given permission, he will stay here.”

Less commonly, an initial adverbial clause is followed by the inversion marker ay (cf. §7.2, subsection (1)):

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay ay pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘He will go to Manila if Father gives him permission.’ (formal style)

Each clause in a complex sentence may be said to be derived from an underlying sentence. The
underlying sentences represented in the above illustrations are, for example:

Pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘He will go to Manila.”

and:

Papayagan siya ng Tatay.
‘Father will give him permission.’

In cases where the complex sentence includes only one intonation phrase (i.e., in cases where there is no
pause between the clauses), the intonation pattern of the sentence underlying the main clause serves as the
intonation pattern of the entire complex sentence. Thus Pupunta siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng
Tatay has the same statement intonation (or the same range of possible statement intonations) as Pupunta
siya sa Maynila. Similarly, the complex sentences:

Pupunta ba siya sa Maynila kung papayagan siya ng Tatay?
‘Will he go to Manila if Father gives him permission?”

and:

Ano ang gagawin niya kung papayagan siya ng Tatay?
‘What will he do if Father gives him permission?’

have, respectively, the yes—no—question intonation and information--question intonation of the sentences
that underlie their main clauses.

In cases where the adverbial clause is initial and is followed by a pause (i.e., in contrastive inversion),
the adverbial clause is given an appropriate non-final intonation pattern, while the main clause retains the
intonation pattern of the sentence that underlies it. Thus the final clauses of the following sentences have,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 465

respectively, statement, yes—no—question, and information—question intonation:

Kung papayagan siya ng Talay, pupunta siya sa Maynila.
‘If Father gives him permission, he will go to Manila.’

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, pupunta ba siya sa Maynila?
‘If Father gives him permission, will he go to Manila?’

Kung papayagan siya ng Tatay, ano ang gagawin niya?
‘If Father gives him permission, what will he do?’

(For a summary of the intonation patterns that occur in statements, yes—no questions, and information
questions, cf. §1.28. For a more detailed treatment of the intonation of contrastive—inversion
constructions, cf. §7.2, subsection (2).)

While main clause normally retains the form of the sentence that underlies it, the adverbial clause
may in some cases represent an altered form of the underlying sentence. The most common altcration that
occurs in adverbial clauses is a change in the form of a verbal predicate. Some subordinating conjunctions
may be followed by basic verb forms (cf. §2.8) as well as by the inflected forms that occur in independent
sentences. An example is the subordinating conjunction bago ‘before,’ as in:

{ matulog
Bago ang mga bata, nagkuwento ako sa kanila.
natulog

‘Before the children went to bed, I told them a story.”

(cf. Natulog ang mga bata.
‘The children went to bed.’
but not: *Matulog ang mga bata.)

Other subordinating conjunctions may be followed only by basic verb forms, never by inflected
forms. An example is para ‘so that,” as in:

Kumain na tayo para makarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
‘Let’s eat now so that I'll be able to get to the station early.’

There is no:

*Kumain na tayo para makakarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
(cf. Makakarating ako sa istasyon nang maaga.
‘T'll be able to get to the station early.’)

There is also a type of alteration that may affect either the adverbial clause or the main clause,
whichever happens to be non-initial: viz., the topic of the non-initial clause is commonly deleted when its
referent is the same as that of the initial clause. In such cases, if the topic is capable of being expressed by a
personal pronoun (i.e., if it represents a human being or pet animal — cf. §3.3), this pronoun may or may
not occur in the non-initial clause: ¢.g.,

Hindi pupunta si Juan sa miting kung pagod (siya).
Kung pagod si Juan, hindi (siya) pupunta sa miting.

‘Juan won’t go to the meeting if he’s tired.’
‘If Juan is tired, he won't go to the meeting.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
466 CHAPTER 6

If the topic is not capable of being expressed by a personal pronoun, the non-initial clause is normally
topicless: e.g.,

Hindi ko bibilhin ang damit kung mahal.
Kung mahal ang damit, hindi ko bibilhin.

‘I won't buy the dress if it’s expensive.’
‘If the dress is expensive, | won’t buy it.’

(Tagalog has no equivalent of English ‘it’ for referring pronominally to inanimate objects — cf. §3.3.)

As is noted in §3.29, subsection (1.A.8), the majority of subordinating conjunctions are obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic (i.e., are never immediately followed by enclitic pronouns or particles). A small number of
subordinating conjunctions are, however, optionally pre-enclitic, and at least two, bago ‘before’ and kundi
‘if... not,’ are obligatorily pre-enclitic (cf. §3.29, subsection (II.A.7)). In subsequent sections special
attention is called to those subordinating conjunctions that are optionally or obligatorily pre-enclitic.

Tagalog adverbial clauses are presented in subsequent sections as follows: time and conditional
clauses in §6.15; cause, result, and purpose clauses in §6.16; concessive clauses in §6.17; other adverbial
clauses in §6.18. (cf. also §7.18 for a presentation of indefinite adverbial clauses.)

§6.15. Time and conditional clauses.

Tagalog time clauses and conditional clauses are conveniently presented together, since there are two
subordinating conjunctions, (ka/pag(ka) and kung, that introduce clauses whose English equivalents are in
some cases time clauses (introduced by ‘when’), in others conditional clauses (introduced by ‘if), and in
still others cither time clauses or conditional clauses. In addition to (ka)pag(ka) and kung, there is one other
subordinating conjunction, (kung) sakali, that introduces conditional clauses, and there are various other
subordinating conjunctions that introduce time clauses. These time clauses are divisible into four main
classes on the basis of the types of predicates that may occur within them. One class accepts either verbless

(i.e., nominal or adjectival) or inflected—verbal predicates; a second accepts either verbless or basic—form
predicates; a third accepts either inflected or basic—form predicates; and a fourth accepts verbless,

inflected, or basic—form predicates.

Tagalog time and conditional clauses are presented below under the following headings. (The
subordinating conjunctions that introduce clauses belonging to the various classes are listed alphabetically
in parentheses after each heading. If a conjunction is analyzable as including a linker (-ng or na/-ng the
linker is written separately, after a plus sign.)

(1) Timefconditional clauses ((Ka/pag(ka), kung, (Kung) sakali + naj-ng)

(2) Clauses with verbless or inflected predicates (haba + na/-ng, hangga't, miyentras { + naj-ng),

noon + ng or naf-ng, ngayon at, ngayon + naf-ng, samantala + naj-ng, tuwi + naf-ng)

(3) Clauses with verbless or basic—form predicates (oras na, sa sandali + na/-ng)

(4) Clauses with inflected or basic—form predicates (bago, hanggang (sa), matapos + -ng or naf-ng,

pagkatapos + ng or na/-ng)

(5S) Clauses with verbless, inflected, or basic—form predicates ((mag)buhat nang, (mag}mula nang,

nang)

(1) TIME/CONDITIONAL CLAUSES. Clauses in this class are introduced by (ka)pag/ka), kung, or
(kung) sakali + naf-ng. (The notation (ka)pag/ka) represents any of the following forms: pag /pag/, kKapag
{kapag/, pagka /pagka’/, kapagka /kapagka‘/. Of these pag is the most common. The notation (kung) sakali
represents kung sakali and sakali. ) (Ka)pag(ka) introduces clauses with verbless or inflected predicates; kung
and (kung) sakali + na/-ng introduce, in addition to these, clauses with basic—form predicates.

Only kung is used in clauses that express a condition that is contrary to fact. The contrary—to-fact
clause may have either a verbless or an inflected predicate. The main clause normally includes the enclitic

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 467

particle sana (cf. §6.5, subsection (¢)), which makes the contrary—to—fact meaning of the kung clause
explicit. Some examples are:

Kung nandito si Rosa, mas masaya sana tayo.
‘If Rosa were here, we would be happier.”

Kung ako si Juan, hindi ko sana ginawa iyon.
‘If T were Juan, I would not have done that.’

Kung aalis ako bukas, binabalot ko sana ang aking kagamitan ngayon.
‘If I were leaving tomorrow, I’d be packing my things today.’

Tumatanggap sana siya ng mabuting marka kung nag-aaral siya.
“He'd be getting a good grade if he were studying.”

Gumaling ka sana agad kung ininom mo ang gamot na ito.
‘You'd have recovered right away if you had taken this medicine.’

Kung (hin)di
) (lamang) napakalayo ng Maynila, papag-aaralin
j ko sana siya roon.
Kundi

‘If (only) Manila weren’t so far away, I’d send him to school there.’

(In contrary—to--fact clauses, kundi ‘if... not’ is an optional contraction of kung and di (itself an
abbreviation of hindi ‘not’ — cf. §7.13). It is often followed by the enclitic particle lamang ‘only’ (cf. §6.4,
subsection (d)). The contraction does not occur in Kung clauses of other types. As is noted in §3.29,
subsection (II.A.7), kundi is obligatorily pre-enclitic. There is a homonymous coordinating conjunction,
kundi ‘but, except,’ which is presented in §7.20.)

Except in the case of clauses that express a condition contrary to fact, Aung and (Ka)pag/ka) are
interchangeable when the clause they introduce has a verbless or an imperfective—aspect verbal predicate.
Such a clause may be equivalent to an English ‘when’ clause (where the ‘when’ clause represents a recurrent
or repeatable situation or action), or to cither an ‘if or a ‘when’ clause. Whatever the English equivalent,
the Tagalog clause expresses a situation or action that is wholly or partly concurrent with that expressed in
the main clause. Some examples are:

(Ka)pag(ka) )

| hindi mo kailangan ito, itatago ko na.

Kung

‘If you don’t need this, Ill put it away now.”
{ (ka)pag(ka)

Maasim ang prutas na ito hilaw.
| kung

‘This fruit is sour when it’s unripe.’

(Ka)pag(ka) )

‘Kung \

‘If/When the weather is good, we go to the seashore.”

l kung
‘I won’t play the piano if Father is sleeping.’
(Ka)pag(ka)

Kung

‘When Juan speaks Tagalog, we laugh.”

{ (kaypag(ka)
Madalas silang dumadalaw sa Lola lumalakad sila buhat sa iskwela.
kung

‘They often visit Grandmother if/when they walk from school.”

(Kung) sakali+na/-ng is not used to introduce a clause with an imperfective—aspect (or a
perfective—aspect) verbal predicate, but may introduce a clause with a verbless predicate, provided the main
clause has a predicate verb in the contemplated aspect. The (Kung) sakali + na/-ng clause is equivalent to an
English clause introduced by ‘if’ or ‘in case’: ¢.g.,

(Kung) sakaling mabuti ang panahon, pupunta kami sa tabing-dagat.
‘If

the weather is good, we'll go to the seashore.”

‘In case (

A clause in which (ka /pag(ka) is followed by a perfective—aspect predicate represents an action to be
completed in the future, prior to the action expressed in the main clause. The (ka)pag/ka) clause is usually

translatable by either an ‘if’ clause or a ‘when’ clause. Examples are:

(Ka)pag(ka) nakita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
“If/When I see him, I'll tell him what happened.’

Bumili ka ng gatas (ka)pag(ka) nagpunta ka sa palengke.
“Buy some milk if/when you go to the market.”

Essentially the same meaning may be expressed by a Aung or (kung) sakali +na/-ng clause with a
contemplated—aspect predicate, except that in these clauses the conditional nature of the action is more
explicit, the English equivalent of the Aung clause normally having ‘if,’ that of the (kung) sakali + na/-ng
clause normally having ‘in case’:

Kung
makikita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kanya ang nangyari.
(Kung) sakaling
‘If }
I see him, I’ll tell him what happened.’

((Kajpag(ka}) does not occur in a clause with a comtemplated—aspect predicate. When kung occurs in a
clause with a perfective—aspect predicate, the clause usually expresses a condition contrary to fact (see
above), but may also express a simple condition in the past: e.g.,

Kung naabutan niya ang bus, hindi siya mahuhuli.
‘If he was able to catch the bus, he won’t bc late.")

A basic verb form alternates freely with a contemplated form in Aung and (kung) sakali + naj-ng
clauses of the type just illustrated. Thus, also:

Kung
makita ko siya, sasabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
(Kung) sakaling
‘If
I see him, I'll tel! him what happened.’
‘In case

A basic verb form may also follow kung (but not (kung) sakali +naj-ng) in a sentence whose main clause is
equational or includes an imperfective verbal predicate. In these cases, the main clause expresses an action
or condition characteristically associated with the action or condition expressed in the Aung clause, and the
kung clause is normally equivalent to an English ‘when’ clause. Normally the topic of the kung clause and
that of the main clause have the same referent in sentences of this type. When this referent is a human being
or pet animal, the non-initial clause either has a personal—pronoun topic or Jacks an expressed topic. When
the referent is not a human being or pet animal, the non-initial clause is topicless. Some examples are:

Kung magsalita ng Ingles si Juan, parang Amerikano (siya).
‘When Juan speaks English, he sounds like an American.’

Kung alisin sa tubig ang isdang ito, namamatay agad.
‘When this fish is taken out of the water, it dies at once.”

Matamis ang prutas na ito kung mahinog.
‘This fruit is sweet when it ripens.”

(As is noted in §3.29, subsection (7), (ka Jpag(ka) is optionally pre-enclitic, while kung is obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic. Thus:

j dinadalaw ko siya, |
(Ka)pag(ka) palagi akong nagdadala ng regalo.
| ko siya dinadalaw, \

‘When I visit him, I always bring a present.’

but only:

Kung dinadalaw ko siya, palagi akong nagdadala ng regalo.
(Same meaning)

(Kung) sakati is optionally pre-enclitic with enclitic particles, and obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with personal
pronouns.

(2) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED OR VERBLESS PREDICATES. Clauses in this class are presented
below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by haba +na/-ng, hangga’t miyentras + (optionally) na/-ng, and
samantala + naj-ng, (b) clauses introduced by noon; (c) clauses introduced by ngayon at and
ngayon + na}-ng;(d) clauses introduced by tuwi + na/-ng.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
470 CHAPTER 6

(a) Haba +na/-ng, hangga't, miyentras, and samantala + naj-ng all introduce clauses equivalent to
English ‘while’ clauses. The clause may have a verbless or an imperfective verbal predicate. Examples are:

Habang narito ako,
Haba akong narito, \

Hangga’t narito ako,

Miyentras narito ako, dapat akong tumulong.
Miyentras ako(ng) warto,}

Samantalang narito a

Samantala akong nariot,

‘While I’m here, I ought to help.’

(Haba, miyentras, and samantala are optionally pre-enclitic; hangga'’t is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic — cf.
§3.29, subsection (II.A.7).)

Habang
Hangga’t
nagtatrabaho si Juan, umaawit siya.
Miyentras
Samantalang
‘While Juan works, he sings.”

Hangga’t may also mean ‘as long as,’ as in:

Hangga’t ginagawa niya ang trabaho, wala akong tutol.
‘As long as he does the work, I have no objection.’

Miyentras, while common in ordinary conversation, is not used in formal speech or writing.
(b) Noon +-ng or na/-ng introduces clauses equivalent to English ‘when’ clauses that refer to

situations or actions that are confined to the past, and that are concurrent with the situation or action
expressed by the main clause. The noon clause may have a verbless or an imperfective verbal predicate.
Examples are:

Nakatira siya sa dormitoryo noong istudyante siya.
‘He lived in the dormitory when he was a student.”

Noon daw (na) nagtatrabaho}
siya sa pabrika, malaki ang suweldo niya.

Noong nagtatrabaho raw

‘They say that when he was working in the factory, his pay was large.’

(The same meanings may be expressed by clauses introduced by nang — see (S.c), below.)
As the last example shown, noon is optionally pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic particles (cf. §6.6,
subsection 2(b)) but obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns (cf. §3.29, subsection (1.A.10)).
(c) Ngayon at and ngayon + naj-ng are equivalent to English ‘now that.’ They introduce clauses with
a verbless predicate or with any inflected verbal predicate. Examples are:

Negayon at}
mayaman na siya, hindi na siya dumadalaw sa amin.

Ngayong |

‘Now that he’s rich, he no longer visits us.’

magsisimula
f ngayon at
Makakatulong na siya nagsisimula siya ng paggawa.

| neayong j nagsimula

{ is about to start
‘He'll soon be able to help now that he is starting to work.”
has started

(d) Tuwi + na/-ng introduces clauses equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘every time (that).’

Imperfective—aspect predicates and contemplated—aspect predicates alternate freely within fuwi + na/-ng
clauses: e.g.,

{ nakikita
Tuwing ko iyon, naaalala ko sila.
makikita
‘Every time I see that, I remember them.”
{ umaalis }
Umiiyak ang bata tuwing sa bahay ang ina.
aalis

‘The child cries every time the mother leaves the house.”

Perfective—aspect predicates do not occur within mawi + na/-ng clauses. Examples of newi + na/-ng clauses
with verbless predicates are:

Tuwing narito si Juan, nagkakaroon kami ng pagtatalo.
‘Every time Juan is here, we have an argument.”

Tuwing may pera daw siya, naglalasing (siya).
‘They say that every time he has some moncy, he gets drunk.’

(Juni is optionally pre-enclitic; thus the following also occurs (cf. the last example above):

Tuwi daw siyang may pera, naglalasing siya.
‘They say that every time he has some money, he gets drunk.’)

(3) CLAUSES WITH BASIC-FORM OR VERBLESS PREDICATES, Clauses in this class are
introduced by oras na or sa sandali + naj/-ng. The clauses are equivalent to English clauses introduced by
‘the moment (that)’ or ‘the minute (that),’ when these clauses refer to future time. Oras na connotes strong
emotion; it is used, for example, in warning or threats: ¢.g.,

Magpapakamatay ako oras na maging di-matapat sa akin ang mangingibig ko.
“I'll kill myself the moment my lover is untrue to me.’

Oras na makita ko siya, itatapon ko ito sa mukha niya.
‘The minute [ see him, I'll throw this in his face.’

Sa sandali + naj-ng lacks this connotation. Some examples are:

Magpalakpakan kayo sa sandaling iabot ko ito sa kaniya.
“‘Applaud the moment | hand this to him.’

{ sandali pong dumating siya,
Sa teteleponohan ko kayo.
| sandaling dumating po siya,

‘The minute he arrives, I'll phone you, sir/madam.”

(As the last example shows, sa sandali is optionally pre-enclitic with enclitic particles, obligatorily
non-pre-enclitic with enclitic pronouns.)

472 CHAPTER 6

(4) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Clauses in this class are
presented below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by bago; (b) clauses introduced by hanggang (sa);
(c) clauses introduced by matapos + -ng or na/-ng ang pagkatapos +-ng or na/-ng.

(a) Bago is equivalent to English ‘before.’ A bago clause with a basic—form predicate is the most
frequent equivalent of an English ‘before’ clause or of a phrase consisting of ‘before” plus the ‘-ing” form of
a verb. A basic—form predicate alternates with, but is preferred to, an imperfective—aspect predicate to
express habitual or repeated action in the present or past. In each of the following examples, the first of the
two alternative verb forms in the bago clause is preferred. (The main clause of a sentence that includes a
bago clause often includes the enclitic particle muna ‘first’ — cf. §6.4, subsection (h).)

mag-aral
Bago siya ‘ ng liksyon, nagbabasa muna (siya) ng diyaryo.
l nag-aaral
reads )
‘Before studying his lessons, he the newspaper (first).’
used to read {
mahinog
Bago ang prutas na ito, maasim.
nahihinog
‘Before this fruit ripens, it’s sour.”
{ magsimula

Dati, palaging may handaan kina Alkalde Guinto bago ang kombensyon.
nagsisimula

‘Formerly, there was always a party at Mayor Guinto’s before the convention started.’

(When, as is often the case, the topic of the bago clause and that of the main clause have the same referent,
the non-initial clause either optionally or obligatorily lacks an expressed topic: optionally when the topic
may be expressed by a personal pronoun (as in the first example above), obligatorily when it may not (as in
the second). As is noted in §3.29, subsection (II.A.7), bago is obligatorily pre-enclitic — cf. the first
example above.)

A basic—form predicate is also used to express contemplated action. If the contemplated action is
habitual, the sentence often includes an adverb such as buhat ngayon ‘from now on,” (pa)lagi ‘always,’ or
gabi-gabi ‘every night.’ Examples are:

f magsasalita ang Alkalde.
Bago magsimula ang miting,
| nandoon na kami,
the Mayor will speak.”
‘Before the meeting starts,
we will be there (already).

Buhat ngayon, lagi nilang isususi ang mga pintuan bago sila matulog.
‘From now on, they will always lock the doors before they go to bed.”

A contemplated—aspect predicate occurs in a bago clause only in sentences expressing strong requests
for future habitual action, as in:

Buhat nga ngayon, lagi mong isususi ang mga pintuan bago ka matutulog.
‘From now on, please lock the doors before you go to bed.”

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 473

(In all other contexts, the basic—form predicate is used to express future habitual action; thus, for example:

Mag-aaral siya ng liksyon niya bago siya matulog gabi-gabi.
‘He will study his lessons before he goes to bed every night.”

but never:
*Mag-aaral siya ng liksyon niya bago siya matutulog gabi-gabi.)

To express completed action, a perfective—aspect predicate is used in the bago clause, as in the
following:

Bago natulog ang mga bata, uminom sila ng gatas.
‘Before the children went to bed, they drank some milk.”

Karpintero siya bago siya nagsimulang magtrabaho dito.
“He was a carpenter before he began to work here.”

A basic—form predicate occurs in the bago clause instead of a perfective—aspect predicate where the verb is
one that normally forms a topicless phenomenal sentence (cf. §7.21) as in the following:

j mag-ala-una.
Dumating sila bago
| mag-Pasko.

one o'clock.’
‘They arrived before

Christmas.”

or where the topic of the bago clause is omitted (by reason of having the same referent as the main clause,
as noted above), as in the following:

Uminom ng gatas ang mga bata bago matulog.
‘The children drank some milk before going to bed.”

Pinitas niya ang mangga bago mahinog.
‘He picked the mango before it got ripe.”

Bago does not normally introduce clauses with an equational structure. In most cases the Tagalog
equivalent of an English ‘before’ clause that includes a form of *be’ plus a predicate nominal or adjectival is

a bago clause with a predicate maging construction (cf. §5.26): e.g.,

naging-Presidente.
Mas masaya siya bago siya
naging-bantog.

{ President.’
‘He was happier before he was/became
{ famous.’

There is no *bago siya Presidente or *bago siya bantog.

Unlike ‘before,’ bago does not occur before a nominal within an adverbial phrase. The Tagalog
equivalent of an English time phrase consisting of ‘before, plus a nominal —e.g., ‘before one o'clock,’
‘before breakfast,” ‘before evening’ — is normally expressed by bago plus a basic—form verb, as in:

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
474 CHAPTER 6

mag-ala-una.
Magpasyal tayo bago mag-almusal,
gumabi.

(it’s) one o'clock.’
“Let's take a walk before (having) breakfast.’
(it’s) evening.’

(b) Hanggang and hanggang sa alternate freely in clauses equivalent to English clauses introduced by
‘until.’ A hanggang (sa) clause with basic—form predicate may occur in a sentence expressing a past,
present, or future situation or action. Examples are:

titira
Hanggang (sa) magkaroon din sila ng sariling bahay, | tumitira sila sa amin.
tumira
get will live
‘Until they get a house of their own (too), they are living with us.”
got lived
Ibibilad
Ibinibilad nila sa araw hanggang (sa) matuyo.
Ibinilad
will expose } ( dries.”
‘They expose it to the sun until it dries.’
l exposed { latiea

A perfective—aspect predicate alternates freely with a basic-form predicate within a hanggang (sa)
clause that expressed a completed action. Thus, also:

Ibinilad nila sa araw hanggang (sa) natuyo.
‘They exposed it to the sun until it dried.’

Contemplated—aspect and imperfective—aspect predicates do not occur after hanggang (sa).

Hanggang is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic (cf. §3.29, subsection (1.A.10)).

(c) As subordinating conjunctions, matapos and pagkatapos are both equivalent to English ‘after.’
(Matapos also occurs as the basic form of a verb meaning ‘finish,’ and pagkatapos as the aspectless
gerund — cf. §3.26 — related to this verb.) They are followed (when used as subordinating conjunctions) by
either the linker -ng or the linker na/-ng. (Occurring directly after matapos or pagkatapos, the linker -ng has
a zero form, the linker na/-ng the form /naf — cf. §§3.8 and 3.11. Since matapos and pagkatapos are both
optionally pre-enclitic — cf. §3.29, subsection (II.A.7) — enclitic personal pronouns and/or particles may
occur between them and the linker, in which case the linker, whether -ng or na/-ng, usually has the form
fal.)

A matapos or pagkatapos clause with a basic—form predicate is the most frequent equivalent of an
English ‘after’ clause or of a phrase consisting of ‘after’ plus the ‘-ing’ form of a verb. Examples are:

mag-aaral
Matapos
(na) linisin ng katulong ang salas nag-aaral ako roon.
Pagkatapos
nag-aral

Umuuwi na siya ang mga sulat.

pagkatapos { | niyang basahin

Umuwi
will go )
‘He goes home right after reading the letters.”
l went j

If the predicate verb in a pagkatapos clause is actor—focus (cf. §2.10), the actor is expressed by ang
phrase, rather than an ang phrase. In a matapos clause with an actor—focus predicate verb, the actor is, as

usual, expressed by an ang phrase. Compare the pagkatapos and matapos clauses in the following sentences:

(na) magtalumpati siya,
Matapos
siyang magtalumpati,
kumanta kami ng ilang awit.
(na) magtalumpati niya,
Pagkatapos
niyang magtalumpati,

‘After he spoke, we sang a few songs.’

matapos (na) kumain ng hapunan ang mga bata.
Aalis kami
pagkatapos (na) kumain ng hapunan ng mga bata.
‘We'll leave after the children eat lunch.’

Contemplated—aspect and imperfective—aspect predicates do not occur after matapos and
pagkatapos. Perfective—aspect predicates are uscd to imply a contradiction between the expected

consequence of the action expressed in the subordinate clause and the actual consequence, as expressed in
the main clause: e.g.,

Matapos

ko siyang tinulungan, sinisi pa niya ako.
Pagkatapos
‘(Even) after I helped him, he still blamed me.”

Like bago (cf. (3.2), above), matapos and pagkatapos do not normally introduce clauses with an
equational structure. (The usual equivalent of an English ‘after’ clause that includes a form of ‘be’ plus a
predicate nominal or adjectival is a mang clause (cf. (S.b), below) with a predicate formed by the

corresponding Tagalog nominal or adjectival — or by a maging construction (cf. §5.17) — followed by the
enclitic na, thus:

{ biyuda \
maging biyuda

Nang na ang reyna, pambihira na siyang naglakbay.

{ matanda
maging matanda

476 CHAPTER 6

was a widow
‘After the queen » She seldom traveled.’)

became old

Again like bago, matapos does not occur before nominals within adverbial phrases. Pagkatapos,
however, occurs before ng plus a nominal in the time—gerund subclass of adverbial phrases (cf. §6.8,
subsection (3).)

(5) CLAUSES WITH VERBLESS, INFLECTED, OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Clauses in this
class are presented below as follows: (a) clauses introduced by (mag)buhat nang and (mag )mula nang;
(b) clauses introduced by nang.

(a) (Mag /buhat nang and (magjmula nang introduce clauses equivalent to English time clauses
introduced by ‘since.’ The clauses may have verbless, basic— form, or perfective—aspect predicates, the latter
two altemating freely. (Clauses with verbless predicates normally include the enclitic particle pa ‘still,
yet’ — cf. §6.2.) Some examples are:

(Mag)buhat bata
nang pa si Linda, gusto na niyang maging mang-aawit.
(Mag)mula maliit
a child
‘Since Linda was , she has wanted to become a singer.’
small

(Mag)buhat mamatay
nang

(Mag)mula namatay
‘Since his wife died, he hasn’t been able to do any work.”

ang awawa niya, hindi na siya nakagawa ng trabaho.

(Mag Jbuhat and (mag}mula are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic pronouns (cf.
§3.29, subsection (1.A.10)), but optionally non-pre-enclitic with respect to enclitic particles (cf. §6.6,
subsection (2.a)).

(b) Nang, like noon + -ng or naj-ng (cf. (2.6), above), introduces clauses equivalent to English ‘when’
clauses that refer to situations or actions confined to the past. A nang clause with a basic—form predicate
expresses an action occurring immediately before the action expressed by the main clause; the English
equivalent of the clause may often be introduced by cither ‘as soon as’ or ‘when.’ Examples are:

Nang makita ko siya, nakilala ko siya agad.
“As soon as

I saw him, I recognized him at once.”
‘When j

Natawa siya nang sabihin ko sa kaniya ang nangyari.
‘He laughed when I told him what had happened.”

A nang clause with a verbless or imperfective—aspect predicate expresses a situation or action
concurrent with that expressed in the main clause. (Nang and noon + na/-ng are interchangeable in such
cases.) Examples are:

Nang nasa unibersidad ba siya, nakatira siya sa dormitoryo?
‘When he was in the university, did he live in the dormitory?’

Nang nagtatrabaho siya sa pabrika, malaki ang suweldo niya.
‘When he was working in the factory, his pay was large.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 477

Contemplated—aspect and perfective—aspect predicates have their usual meanings in nang clauses:

Nang aalis na ako, tinawag niya ako,
‘When I was about to leave, he called me.”

Nasa Maynila sila nang nagsimula ang World War II.
‘They were in Manila when World War II began.”

§6.16. Cause, result, and purpose clauses.

The equivalent of an English clause introduced by ‘because’ is expressed by a Tagalog clause
introduced by one of the following subordinating conjunctions: dahil (sa), dahilan sa, gawa ng, porke,
(sa)pagka't. Dahil (sa), dahilan sa, and gawa ng are common in both formal and informal contexts. Porke is
used only in informal contexts, and expresses an ironic or critical attitude (often expressible in English by
‘just because’). (Sa/pagka't is more common in formal than in informal contexts. Subordinate clauses
expressing cause (and those expressing result — see below) may have verbless or inflected predicates, but
not basic—form predicates. Some examples are:

Dahil (sa)

Dahilan sa nahuli ako, hindi ko narinig ang takdang aralin.
Gawa ng

‘Because | was late, I didn’t hear the assignment.”

dahil (sa)
Hindi siya makakadalo sa pulong dahilan sa marami siyang gawain.

| gawa ng
‘He won’t be able to go to the meeting because he has a lot to do.”

{ tumanggap siya )
Porke ng mabuting marka, hindi na siya nakikipag-usap sa atin.

siya tumanggap f
‘Just because he got a good grade, he no longer speaks to us.”

(Sa)pagka’t mataba ang lupa, umunlad ang mga dayuhan.
“Because the land was rich, the immigrants prospered.”

(Porke is optionally pre-enclitic; the other subordinating conjunctions are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.)
The equivalent of an English clause introduced by ‘since’ (in the meaning ‘as a result of the fact that’)
is expressed in Tagalog by a clause introduced by /ya)yaman plus the linker na/-ng. Examples are:

(Ya)yaman daw na umuulan, ipapapagpaliban ang laro.
‘They say that since it’s raining, the game will be postponed.”

Mag-aaral ako bukas (ya)yamang walang panahon ngayon.
‘T'll study tomorrow since there’s no time today.”

The subordinating conjunction kaya introduces clauses that express the result of the action expressed
by the main clause. When the kaya clause follows the main clause, it is often translatable by an English
clause introduced by ‘with the result that’ or ‘so’: e.g.,

Tinukso ni Juan ang bata, kaya umiyak.
‘Juan teased the child, with the result that it cried.’

May tipan ako nang alas dos, kaya dapat akong umalis.
‘L have an appointment at two o‘clock, so I have to leave.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
478 CHAPTER 6

When the kaya clause is sentence—initial, it is often translatable by an English clause introduced by ‘the
reason (that),’ with ‘is/was that” preceding the equivalent of the non-initial clause. The non-initial clause
may optionally be preceded by dahil (sa), without change of meaning. Examples are:

Kaya umiyak ang bata, (dahil (sa)) tinukso ni Juan.
‘The reason that the child cried was that Juan teased her.’

Kaya dapat akong umalis, (dahil (sa)) may tipan ako nang alas dos.
‘The reason I have to leave is that I have an appointment at two o'clock.’

Clauses expressing purpose (equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘(in order) to,’ ‘in order that,’
‘so that’) are introduced by para, or upang. Para may be used in cither informal or formal contexts, upang
only in formal contexts. Only basic--form verbal predicates occur in purpose clauses. Some examples are:

para

Matulog na tayo makaalis tayo nang maaga bukas.
upang

‘Let's go to bed now so that we can leave early tomorrow.”

Para )
hindi magutom ang mga bata, nagdala kami ng tinapay.

Upang

‘In order that the children would not get hungry, we took along some bread.’

para
Nagpunta siya sa bayan bumili ng mga kasangkapan.

upang
‘He went to town to buy some tools.”

(In some cases, purpose may also be expressed by a clause introduced by the coordinating conjunction at
nang — cf. §7.19, subsection (7).)

§6.17. Concessive clauses.

Tagalog concessive clauses (equivalent to English clauses introduced by ‘(al)though,’ ‘even though,”
‘even if, ‘in spite of the fact that,” etc.) may be introduced by one of a variety of subordinating
conjunctions. A concessive meaning may also be expressed by the use of certain enclitic particles.
Concessive clauses introduced by subordinating conjunctions are divisible into three classes on the basis of
the types of verbal predicates that may occur within them:

(1) Clauses with inflected predicates (clauses introduced by bagaman (at), bagama’t, ganoong,
gayong)

(2) Clauses with basic-form predicates (clauses introduced by (ka)sukdulan +na/-ng,
matuluyan + naj/-ng, sukdan + na/-ng, huwag (na} (hin }di)

(3) Clauses with either inflected or basic—form predicates (clauses introduced by kahit (na), maski

(na})

(Nominal or adjectival predicates may occur in clauses of classes (1) and (3). In clauses of class (2), nominal
or adjectival predicates may occur after huwag (na) (hin di.) Concessive clauses involving enclitic particles
constitute two additional classes:

(4) Man clauses
(5) na... paandpa... na clauses

ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 479

The classes are presented below in the order listed.
(1) CLAUSES WITH INFLECTED PREDICATES. Bagaman (at) and bagama't are equivalent to
English ‘(al)though.’ Examples are:

mag-aaral,
Bagaman (at) }
hindi sila nag-aaral, umaasa silang pumasa.
Bagama’t {
nag-aral,
{ aren’t going to
‘Although they don’t study, they expect to pass.”
| aian'
{ bagaman (at)
Nagmamaneho siya ng kotse wala sa hustong gulang.
bagama’t

‘He drives a car though he’s not of age.’

Ganoong and gayong are equivalent to English ‘in spite of the fact that’ or ‘even though.’ Their use
implies criticism or disapproval of the action or situation expressed in the main clause. Examples are:

Ganoong |
may sakit siya, nagpipilit na pumarito.
Gayong \
‘In spite of the fact that he’s sick, he insists on coming.”
babayaran
{ ganoong
Hindi raw nila gagawin ang trabaho binabayaran mo sila.
| savone
binayaran
( are going to pay
‘They say they won't do the work even though you are paying them.’
paid

Bagaman is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns, optionally pre-enclitic with respect
to enclitic particles; the other conjunctions are obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.

(2) CLAUSES WITH BASIC- FORM PREDICATES, (Ka)sukdulan + naj-ng, matuluyan + na/-ng, and
sukdan + naf-ng introduce clauses that express a hypothetical future action or situation; they are equivalent
to English ‘even though’ or ‘even if.’ Examples are:

(ka)sukdulang

Hindi ko ibibigay ito sa kaniya matuluyang pagbantaan niya ako.
sukdang j

‘I won’t give this to him even if he should threaten me.”

(Ka)sukdulan

Matuluyan siyang magalit, ipapasuri nila siya sa doktor.
Sukdan

‘Even though he may get angry, they’ll have the doctor examine him.’

480 CHAPTER 6

The notation huwag (na) (hindi represents any of the following: huwag na hindi, huwag na di,
huwag hindi, huwag di. These subordinating conjunctions are equivalent to English ‘however little,” ‘even
if... just ...a little.” Examples are:

Huwag (na) (hin)di ako kumain, tumataba ako.
‘However little I cat, I still get fat.’

Umiiyak ang bata huwag (na) (hin)di mo tuksuhin.
‘The child cries even if you just tease it a little.’

(Huwag (na) is non-pre-enclitic; (hin di is obligatorily pre-enclitic.)

(3) CLAUSES WITH EITHER INFLECTED OR BASIC-FORM PREDICATES. Before an inflected
predicate, kahit (na) and maski (na) are similar in meaning to ganoong and gayong (cf. (1), above), except
that their use does not necessarily imply criticism or disapproval of the action expressed in the main clause.

babayaran
Kahit )
(na) binabayaran mo sila, hindi mo maipapagawa iyon sa kanila.
Maski {
binayaran
{ are going to pay
‘Even though you are paying them, you can’t ask them to do that.”
l paid
magagalit
{ kahit
Kakausapin ko rin siya (na) nagagalit sa akin.
l maski
nagalit
will get }
‘Tl talk to him anyway, even though he is getting angry with me.”
got j

Before a basic—form predicate, kahit (na) and maski (na) are similar in meaning to kasukdulan + naj-ng, etc.
(cf. (2), above). Examples are:

Kahit

(na) pagbantaan din niya ako, hindi ko ibibigay ito sa kaniya.
Maski
‘Even if he should threaten me too, I won’t give this to him.’

{ kahit
Hindi mababasag ito (na) ibagsak mo.
(maa)

‘This won’t break even if you should drop it.”

(Maski is optionally pre-enclitic; thus, also: maski niya ako pagbantaan; maski mo ibagsak. The na that
frequently follows maski is an enclitic particle (cf. §6.3). If both na and other enclitics follow maski, their
order follows the rules given in §6.2. Thus: maski na niya ako pagbantaan; maski mo na ibagsak.

(4) Man CLAUSES. The enclitic particle nian occurs in a concessive clause equivalent to an English
clause introduced by ‘even if or ‘even though’ (cf. §6.4, subsection (a.2)). (The main clause optionally but
commonly includes the enclitic particle dinfrin.) Like kahit (na) and maski (na) clauses (cf. (3), above),

Elements sous droits d'auteur
ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS 481

man clauses with basic-form predicates express a hypothetical future situation or action, while those with

imperfective, perfective, or verbless predicates express an actual situation or action. Man is not used in
concessive clauses with predicate verbs in the contemplated aspect. Some examples are:

Sabihin ko man ang totoo, hindi ka rin maniniwala sa akin.
“Even if I tell the truth, you still won't believe me.’

{ nagagalit )

man siya sa akin.
| nagalit j

Kakausapin ko pa rin siya

{ is getting
‘Til talk to him anyway, even though he angry with me.”

l got

Mahal man ang sapatos, binili ko rin.
‘Even though the shoes were expensive, I bought them anyway.”

(5) Na... pa and pa... na clauses. Occurring in successive clauses, the enclitic particles na and pa,
or pa and na, indicate incompatibility between the actions, conditions, etc., expressed by the clauses. The
clauses may have verbless or inflected predicates. In some cases it is the na clause that is equivalent to an
English clause introduced by ‘(al)though’ or ‘even though’; in other cases it is the pa clause. (A more
detailed explanation is given in §6.3, subsection (7).) Some examples are:

Dumarating na ang mga bisita, maglilinis ka pa ng bahay.
‘Even though the guests are already arriving, you're going to clean house.”

Umalis na si Juan sa mesa, kumakain pa ang mga iba.
‘Juan left the table, even though the others were still eating.’

Mainit na mainit pa ang kape, ininom na niya.
‘Although the coffee was still very hot, he drank it anyway.”

Isinuot pa niya ang damit, luma na.
‘She wore the dress though it was already worn out.”

(The English equivalents of sentences with na... pa or pa... na clauscs may often involve ‘and’ or ‘but.’
Thus the first of the above examples may also be translated ‘The guests are already arriving, and you're
going to clean house!’ and the third may be translated ‘The coffee was still very hot, but he drank it
anyway.’)

§6.18. Other adverbial clauses.

Subordinating conjunctions not presented in §§6.15 through 6.17 are presented below as
follows: (1) bukod sa; (2) dangan at, danga’t; (3) imbis + na/-ng, (sa) halip + na/-ng, (sa) lugar + naj-ng; (4)
maliban kung.

(1) Bukod sa is equivalent to English ‘besides (the fact that).’ A bukod sa clause may have a verbless
or an inflected predicate. Some examples are:

Nag-aalaga siya ng hayop, bukod sa nagtatrabaho siya sa bukid.
‘He raises animals, besides working in the field.”

darating

Bukod sa dumarating na sila, marami pa akong ibang problema.
dumating

482 CHAPTER 6°

have already arrived,

‘Besides the fact that they

Bukod is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns, but optionally non-pre-enclitic with
respect to enclitic particles.

(2) Dangan at and its contracted form danga’t are equivalent to English ‘were it not (for the fact)
that.’ A dangan at (or danga’t) clause may have a verbless or an inflected predicate; the clause frequently
includes the enclitic particles nga /a/mang. The main clause normally includes the enclitic particle sana (cf.
§6.5, subsection (e)). Examples are:

dangan (nga la(ma)ng) at malayo )

Bibilhin ko sana ang bahay, sa siyudad.

danga’t malayo (nga la(ma)ng) j
‘I would buy the house, were it not for the fact that it’s far from the city.”

aalis
Dangan at
umaalis na ang mga bisita, gagawa pa sana ako ng kape.
Danga’t
umalis
are leaving soon, )
‘Were it not for the fact that the guests are already leaving, I'd make some
have already left, f more coffee.”

(3) Imbis + naf-ng, (sa) halip + naj-ng and (sa) lugar + na/-ng are equivalent to English ‘instead of.’
The clauses they introduce have basic~form predicates. Jmbis, halip, and lugar are optionally pre-enclitic.

Examples are:

Imbis
na mag-aral siya,

(Sa) halip naglalalaro ng besbol.
siyang mag-aral,

(Sa) lugar

‘Instead of studying, he’s playing baseball.’
imbis )

Umalis sila sa halip na tumulong sa amin.
(sa) lugar

‘They left instead of helping us.’

(4) Maliban kung is equivalent to English ‘unless’ or ‘except when.’ A maliban kung clause may have
a verbless, basic-form, or inflected predicate. A basic—form predicate alternates frecly with a
contemplated—aspect predicate to express a future possibility: ¢.g.,

samahan

Hindi ako pupunta roon maliban kung mo ako.
sasamahan

‘L won’t go there unless you go with me.”

Examples of imperfective, perfective, and verbless predicates are:

Maliban kung kumakain siya, lagi siyang nakatabako,
‘Except when he is eating, he is always smoking a cigar.’

Darating si Linda mamaya, maliban kung hindi siya pinayagan.
‘Linda will be coming later, unless she wasn’t given permission.’

Maliban kung may pera si Rosa, hindi tayo makakapasok sa sine.
‘Unless Rosa has some money, we won’t be able to go to the movies.”

Maliban is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic with respect to pronouns but optionally non-pre-enclitic with
respect to enclitic particles; Ang is obligatorily non-pre-enclitic.

Derived and Minor Sentence Structures

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 485

§7.1. Introduction.

Many types of DERIVED CONSTRUCTIONS (i.e., constructions that do not themselves occur in
basic sentences, but that are related to constructions that do so occur) have been presented in Chapters 3
through 6. The derived constructions presented in these chapters are those that are best understood in
relation to a particular class of basic—sentence components: nominals, adjectivals, verbals, or adverbials (cf.
§3.1). In addition to derived constructions of these types, Tagalog has a number of derived constructions
that are equally related to two or more classes of basic—sentence components. These derived constructions
are discussed in the present chapter. Also discussed in this chapter are MINOR SENTENCE
STRUCTURES: i.e., sentence structures that lack, and fail to reflect, the predicate—plus—topic structure
of basic sentences.

The present chapter is arranged as follows. §7.2 deals with inversion constructions, § §7.3 through
7.12 with questions, and §§7.13 through 7.16 with negation. The remaining sections deal with: the
definitized predicate (7.17), indefinite forms and constructions (7.18), coordination (7.19), explanatory at
clauses (7.20), topicless phenomenal sentences (7.21), social formulas (7.22), and interjections (7.23).

§7.2. Inversion constructions..

An INVERSION CONSTRUCTION is a construction characterized by the shifting to sentence—initial
or clause—initial position of some sentence component that does not occur in this position in basic
sentences. Inversion constructions may involve the placement of a topic before a predicate, the placement
of an adverbial before a predicate, the placement of a verb complement before a predicate verb, the
placement of a phrase introduced by ni or ni... ni before the negator wala (cf. §7.14), or one of certain
combinations of these. The inversion constructions that occur in Tagalog are dealt with below under the
following headings: (1) AY INVERSION; (2) CONTRASTIVE INVERSION; (3) EMPHATIC INVERSION;
(4) NON-EMPHATIC INVERSION.

(1) AY INVERSION. Of the four classes of inversion constructions, ay inversion permits the widest
range of sentence—component types to be shifted to initial position. The initial component in an
ay-inversion construction may be: (a) the topic; (b) an adverbial; (c)a verb complement; (d) a phrase
introduced by ni or ni... ni. The inversion—marking particle ay in most cases immediately follows the
initial topic, adverbial, etc. As is noted in §6.6, however, certain enclitic particles, if they occur in the
sentence, either obligatorily or optionally precede ay. Ay may also be immediately preceded by a pause.
This pause, which is represented in the writing system by a comma, is optional in all cases.

Ay has two forms: a full form, /’ay/, written ay in conventional spelling, and a contracted form, /y/,
written 'y in conventional spelling. The full form may occur in any context; the contracted form occurs as a
variant of the full form if the preceding word, in its independent occurrences, ends in /’/, /h/, /n/, or /w/,
and if this word is not followed by a pause. When the contracted form is used, it replaces a final /’/, /h/, or
/nf, and either replaces or follows a final /w/. Thus, bata /ba‘ta’/ ‘child’ plus 'y is /ba‘tay/, ama f’amah/
‘father’ plus 'y is /’amay/, pinsan /pinsan] ‘cousin’ plus ’y is /pinsay/, and ikaw /"ikaw/ ‘you’ plus 'y is either
likay/ or fikawy/. The contracted form of ay is more commonly used than the full form in the case of
words that, in their independent occurrences, end in /*/ or /h/. In the case of words that end in /n/ in their
independent occurrences, the contracted and full forms of ay are equally common if the word is of native
Tagalog origin: thus, either pinsan ay or pinsa’y. If the word is a loan—word from English or Spanish,
however, the full form is in most cases preferred: thus, Helen ay, rather than Hele’y, and Juan ay, rather
than Jua’y. In the case of words that end in /w/ in their independent occurrences, the contracted and full
forms are equally common in all cases. Whether or not the /w/ is retained in pronunciation, it is always
retained in conventional writing: thus ikaw'y (never *ika'y).

A sentence involving ay inversion does not differ in denotative meaning from the related sentence
without inversion. There is usually, however, a difference in stylistic level, or level of usage, between the
two sentences. Ay inversion is characteristic of formal style, and is more common in writing, lectures,
sermons, etc., than it is in ordinary conversation. In the examples of ay inversion given below, the notation
“(formal style)” is usually placed after the translations of the sentences. (But see (1.a.3), etc., following.
486 CHAPTER 7

Some examples of ay- inversion constructions involving the placement of the sentence topic in initial
position are:

Ang mga anak ay kayamanan ng mga magulang.
‘Children are the parents’ jewels.” (formal style)

(cf. Kayamanan ng mga magulang ang mga anak.
‘Children are the parents’ jewels.’)

Kayo’y mabait na mabait.
“You are very kind.’ (formal style)

(cf. Mabait na mabait kayo.
‘You are very kind.’)

Ang sulat ay tinanggap ko kahapon.
‘I received the letter yesterday.’ (formal style)

(cf. Tinanggap ko ang sulat kahapon.
‘I received the letter yesterday.”)

(a) The following features of constructions involving ay inversion of the topic may be noted:
(a.1) When the inverted topic is the second—person—singular pronoun, the form ikaw replaces the

usual topic form ka (cf. §3.3). Thus:

Ikaw ay nakita nila roon.
‘They saw you there.’ (formal style)

(cf. Nakita ka nila roon.
‘They saw you there.’)

Similarly, ikaw... ko replaces the composite pronoun Kita (which, as is noted in §3.3, is itself a
replacement of the non-occurring sequence “ko ka.) Thus:

Ikaw ay nakita ko roon.
‘I saw you there.’ (formal style)

(cf. Nakita kita roon.
‘I saw you there.’)

(a.2) Inay inversion the topic marker ang is optionally delectable before the limiters bawa’t ‘each’ and
lahat ‘all’ (cf. §3.22). Thus:

Ang bawa’t

bata’y may desk.
Bawa’t

‘Each child has a desk.” (formal style)

(cf. May desk ang bawa’t bata.
‘Each child has a desk.’)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 487

Ang lahat
ng tao’y narito na.
Lahat
‘All the people are here now.’ (formal style)

(cf. Narito na ang lahat ng tao.
‘All the people are here now.’)

(a.3) In the case of certain sentence types where nominal—clause predicates occur opposite
nominalized—verbal topics (cf. §3.24) or opposite nominalized pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb—phrase
topics (cf. §4.21), either ay inversion or contrastive inversion of topic and predicate is obligatory. An
example of ay inversion involving a nominalized—verbal topic is:

Ang narinig ko’y darating siya bukas.
“What I heard is that he’s coming tomorrow.”

Examples involving nominalized pseudo—verb and psuedo—verb—phrase topics are:

dapat
Ang ay tumira sila dito.
nais ko
is fitting
‘What is for them to live here.’
I wish

(There is no *Darating siya bukas ang narinig ko, *Tumira sila dito ang dapat, or *Tumira sila dito ang nais
ko.)

The usual formal connotation of ay inversion does not necessarily obtain in such cases. Similarly,
when contrastive inversion — cf. (2), below — is used in such cases, the usual contrastive connotation of the
construction may be absent.

(a.4) As is noted in §4.12, an ang—phrase topic is normally replaced by a ng phrase in sentences with
ptedicate adjectives that include the intensive prefix napaka-: thus, Napakatamad ng bata ‘The child is very
lazy,’ not *Napakatamad ang bata. If, however, the order of predicate and topic is reversed in ay inversion,
the topic is expressed by an ang phrase: thus,

Ang bata’y napakatamad.
‘The child is very lazy.’ (formal style)

(a.5) In a construction involving a pscudo—verb or pscudo—verb phrase plus a linker plus a clause (ef.
$4.21), the inverted topic of the clause may occur either before or after the pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb
phrase. Examples are:

kailangang !

Sina Ben ay
kailangan kong,

magtanim ng gulay.

Kailangang
sina Ben ay
Kailangan kong
‘It is necessary for
Ben and the others to plant vegetables.’ (formal style)
“I need

(cf. magtanim ng gulay sina Ben.

‘I need f

(b) Most movable adverbs (cf. §§6.7 through 6.11), and any adverbial clause (§ §6.14 through
6.18), may occur in initial position in ay inversion. Some examples involving movable adverbs are:

Noong Lunes
Doon ay ipinagbili niya ang kalabaw niya.
Dahil doon

last Monday.”
‘He sold his carabaw there.’ (formal style)
because of that.’

noong Lunes.
(cf. Ipinagbili niya ang kalabaw niya doon.

dahil doon.

last Monday.”
“He sold his carabaw there.’
because of that.”

The movable adverbs that do not undergo ay inversion are: frequency adverbs formed with beses or
ulit (cf. §6.8, subsection (1.)); palagi ‘always’ (cf. §6.8, subsection (1.g)), point—time adverbs that consist
of nang and the name of a part of the day (e.g., wnaga ‘morning’, gabi ‘night’ — cf. §6.8, subsection (1.a)); |
referential adverbs (cf. §6.11, subsection (1.c)); and manner adverbs (cf. §6.10). The following, for
example, do not occur.

beses |
*Dalawang ay pumarito siya. |
ulit I
beses.
(cf. Pumarito siya nang dalawang
ulit.
‘He came here twice.’)
*Palagi ay namimili sila dito.

(cf. Namimili sila ditong palagi.) M
‘They always go shopping here.’)

*Gabi ay aalis siya.
(cf. Aalis siya nang gabi.
“He will leave at night.’)
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 489

*Tungkol sa giyera ay nagkwento siya.
(cf. Nagkwento siya tungkol sa giyera.
‘He told a story about the war.’)

*Paismid ay nilunok niya ang pildoras.
(cf. Nilunok niya ang pildoras nang paismid.
‘He swallowed the pill with a grimace.’)

As is noted in §6.7, adverbs that in non-initial position are introduced by the linker na/-ng or the
marker nang lose this introductory element when they occur initially, thus:

Madalas ay pumupunta siya dito.
‘He comes here often.’ (formal style)

dito nang’
(cf. Pumupunta siya madalas,
ditong
‘He comes here often.”)

(This loss of introductory na/-ng or nang before inverted adverbials obtains in the case of all inversion
constructions, and is not commented on separately in subsections (2), (3), and (4) below.)
Examples of ay inversion of adverbial clauses are:

Pagdating ko sa Pilipinas ay nagpunta ako sa Baguio.
“I went to Baguio on arriving in the Philippines.’
(formal style)

(cf. Nagpunta ako sa Baguio pagdating ko sa Pilipinas.
‘I went to Baguio on arriving in the Philippines.)

Kung mabuti ang ani’y makakabili ako ng traktor.
‘T'll be able to buy a tractor if the harvest is good.”

(formal style)

(cf. Makakabili ako ng traktor kung mabuti ang ani.
‘Pil be able to buy a tractor if the harvest is good.”)

(In addition to movable adverbs and adverbial clauses, Tagalog has certain adverbs that occur only in
sentence—initial or clause—initial position, and that must be followed either by ay or by pause (cf. §6.12,
subsection (2)). The usual formal connotation of ay- inversion constructions does not necessarily obtain in
cases where ay follows one of these adverbs. An example is:

Alalaong baga’y hindi niya magagawa iyon.
‘In other words, he can’t do it.’

(There is no *Hindi niya magagawa iyon alalaong baga.))
It is possible, although not very usual, for a single sentence or clause to show ay inversion of both an
adverb and a topic. In this case, the sentence or clause includes two inversion markers. The adverb and the

topic may occur in either order: e.g.,

Kami’y bukas ay pupunta.
Bukas ay kami’y pupunta.
‘We'll go tomorrow.’ (formal style)

(cf. Pupunta kami bukas.
‘We'll go tomorrow.’)

490 CHAPTER 7

(c) Certain complements of predicate verbs occur initially in ay inversion. (Inversion is in some cases
obligatory — see below.) In ay inversion of a verb complement, the inversion marker ay may be replaced by

a pause with no resultant change in meaning. (In most other cases, the occurrence of a pause in place of ay
marks contrastive inversion (sce subsection (2), below), and the resultant sentence involves contrastive

meaning. In the examples given below, only forms that include ay are shown, but it is to be understood that
ay may be replaced by a pause in each case.)

Verb complements that may occur initially in ay inversion are: (c.1) indefinite and other object
complements preceded by kahit; (c.2) indefinite actor complements and directional complements, other
than actor complements with nisuman; (c.3) indefinite—nominal—clause complements; (c.4) complements
introduced by ni or ni... ni. (Cf. §7.18 for a treatment of indefinite constructions, and §7.16 for ni and
ni... ni.)

(c.1) The marker ng is deleted before an inverted object complement introduced by kahit. Examples
are:

ilan
Kahit (na) ano ay bibili si Marcos.
sampung dusena

any number."
‘Marcos will buy ¢ anything.” (formal style)
even ten dozen,

ilan.
(cf. Bibili si Marcos ng kahit (na) {ae
sampung dusena.)

(c.2) The marker ng is also deleted before an inverted indefinite actor complement. Examples are:

sino
Kahit ay hindi mabubuhat nang nag-issa
sinuman) 7
\ ang kahong iyon.
Sinuman
‘No one can lift that box by himself.’ (formal style)
(Literally: That box cannot be lifted by anyone alone.’)

sino

nang nag-iisa
sinuman

(cf. Hindi mabubuhat ng kahit

ang kahong iyan.)
sinuman

Examples of sentences with inverted indefinite directional complements are:

ay makakaabot ang koreyo.

a (na) “ent

Saanman
‘The mail can reach any place.’ (formal style)

kahit (na) saan
(cf. Makakaabot ang koreyo )

saanman.
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 491

(c.3) Examples of inverted indefinite nominal clauses serving as (a) object and (b) directional
complements are:

™

(a) \ Kahit (na)

anuman} | ang hingin mo sa kaniya ay bibigyan ka niya.
Anuman

‘He'll give you whatever you ask him for.’ (formal style)

psn Ll

| sauman
ang hingin mo sa kaniya.)

(cf. Bibigyan ka niya

Kahit (na) saan(man)

(b) tayo pumunta ay pupunta siya.
Saanman

“He’ll go wherever we go.’ (formal style)

kahit (na) saan
(cf. Pupunta siya tayo pumunta.
saanman

“He’ll go wherever we go.”)

(For a discussion of the deletion of ng before an indefinite—object—complement clause, cf. §7.18.)
Inversion is obligatory in the case of indefinite nominal clauses serving as actor complements. Thus,
for example:

sino

Kahit (na) ang pumasok dito ay makikita iyan.
sinuman

Sinuman

‘Anyone who enters this place can sec that.’
but not:

kahit (na) sino

*Makikita iyan ng ang pumasok dito.

sinuman

(c.4) As is noted in §7.16, ay inversion is obligatory where the nominal in an object complement
introduced by ni is a deictic pronoun. Thus, for example:

Ni ito ay hindi umiinom si Rosa.
‘Rosa does not drink even this.”

but not:

*Hindi umiinom si Rosa ni ito.

Ay inversion is optional in the case of other object—complement phrases introduced by ni and of
coordinate object—complement phrases introduced by ni... ni. Some examples are:

‘Rosa did not bring

anuman.

Ni damit ni sapatos ay hindi nakakabili ang taong iyon.

‘That man is able to buy neither clothes nor shoes.’ (formal style)

(cf. Hindi nakakabili ni damit ni sapatos ang taong iyon.)

Ay inversion is obligatory in the case of actor complements introduced by ni orni... ni. (Cf. §7.16
for a discussion of the replacement of mg forms by ang forms after ni.) Examples are:

ang Tatay
si Pedro
Ni ay hindi mabubuhat ito.

(but not, for example:

As in the case of ay inversion of verb complements (cf. (c), above), av may be replaced by a pause
with no resultant change in meaning.

(2) CONTRASTIVE INVERSION. Contrastive inversion involves the shifting to initial position of
the topic or of an adverbial. In contrastive inversion, the initial topic or adverbial (plus, possibly, one or
more enclitic particles — cf. §6.6) constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is followed by a pause,
which is represented in conventional writing by a comma. In statements involving contrastive inversion, the
intonation pattem of the initial phrase is one of the following: /2t/, /23>/, /23V (respectively, pattern 1.3
(§1.24), pattern I1.3 (§1.25), and pattern IV.2 (§1.27)); the use of the last of these patterns emphasizes
the contrastive significance of the sentence — see below. In questions involving contrastive inversion, the
initial phrase takes the intonation pattern /34/ (pattern I.1, §1.24). The non-initial intonation phrase of a
contrastive inversion construction takes any intonation pattern appropriate to the sentence type.

In statements with contrastive inversion, both the element before the pause (i.e., the topic or the
adverb) and the element after the pause (i.c., the predicate plus any other sentence component(s) that may
accompany it) normally carry contrastive meaning. Each element is contrasted — at least implicitly — with a
structurally similar element in a second sentence. For example, the sentence:

Kami, magpapahinga.
‘We will rest.’

implies a contrast between kami and some other topic, and between mtagpapahinga and some other
predicate. A possible context in which the sentence might occur is:

Kami, magpapahinga. Kayo, magtatrabaho.
‘We will rest. You will work.’

(cf. Magpapahinga kami. Magtatrabaho kayo.
‘We will rest. You will work.’)

Similarly the sentence:

Bukas, magpapahinga kami.
‘Tomorrow, we'll rest.’

implies a contrast between bukas and some other time adverb, and between magpapahinga kami and some
other predicate—plus—topic structure. A possible context in which the sentence might occur is:

Bukas, magpapahinga kami. Ngayon, dapat kaming magtrabaho.
‘Tomorrow, we'll rest. Today, we’ve got to work.’

(cf. Magpapahinga kami bukas. Dapat kaming magtrabaho ngayon.
‘We'll rest tomorrow. We've got to work today.”)

As the translations of the above sentences show, the English equivalents of sentences with contrastive
inversion normally involve contrastive intonation (indicated in writing by underscoring or italicizing the

words that receive special pitch prominence). In cases where the initial element of the Tagalog sentence is
an adverbial, the English equivalent may also involve inversion.

494 CHAPTER 7

(In certain cases the contrastive meaning of a sentence with an initial adverbial followed by pause
may not be clear unless a specifically contrastive non-final intonation pattern ~ the pattern /231/ — is used
for the adverbial. This is particularly true in cases where the initial adverbial is a clause. Thus the sentence:

Kung mabuti ang panahon, magpipiknik kami.
‘If the weather is good, we’ll have a picnic.”

need not imply a contrast if some non-contrastive non-final intonation pattern is used for the initial clause.)
In questions with contrastive inversion, only the prepausal element normally carries contrastive
meaning. For example, a sentence like:

Si Juan, kumusta?
{ ‘(And) how is Juan?’ \
‘(And) Juan, how is he?”

(cf. Kumusta si Juan?
‘How is Juan?’)

would be likely to occur in a situation where one had already asked after the health of some other
person(s). Similarly, a sentence like:

Kung Mayo, mainit ba?

{ ‘(And) is it hot in May?” \
(And) in May, is it hot?’

(cf. Mainit ba kung Mayo?
‘Is it hot in May?’)

would be likely to occur in a situation where one had already been told that it was hot at some other time

of year.
A single sentence or clause cannot have contrastive inversion of both the topic and an adverbial.

Contrastive inversion may, however, be combined with ay inversion (cf. (1), above), as in the following
examples:

Bukas, kami’y magpapahinga.
‘Tomorrow, we'll rest.’ (formal style)

Kami, bukas ay magpapahinga.
‘We will rest tomorrow.’ (formal style)

Some further examples of contrastive—inversion constructions with initial topics are:

Ang asawa ni Jose, mayamang mayaman.

 

‘Jose’s wife
is very rich.’
‘Jose's wife

(cf. Mayamang mayaman ang asawa ni Jose.
‘Jose's wife is very rich.”)
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 495

Ang panganay, opisyal sa hukbo.
officer in the |

 

‘The eldest (child) is an
officer in the army.”

(cf. Opisyal sa hukbo ang panganay.
‘The eldest (child) is an officer in the army.’)

(As the translations of these sentences show, there may be ambiguity about which element within an
inverted topic or predicate carries contrastive meaning. Thus in the first sentence the topic ang asawa ni
Jose ‘Jose’s wife’ may contrast with such phrases as ang asawa ni Juan ‘Juan’s wife’ or ang ina ni Jose ‘Jose’s
mother,” as well as with any other word or phrase that designates a person: e.g., si Helen ‘Helen.’ Similarly,
in the second sentence the predicate opisyal sa hukbo ‘an officcr in the army’ may contrast with such
phrases as praybet sa hukbo ‘a private in the army’ or opisyal sa hukbong-dagat ‘an officer in the navy,’ as
well as with any other word or phrase that designates an occupation: e.g., abogado ‘a lawyer.’ The
contrastive—inversion construction indicates that there is contrast between some element within each
intonation phrase and a structurally similar element of another sentence, either expressed or implied, but it
does not necessarily indicate exactly which element carrics contrastive meaning.)

With one exception, all of the features of ay inversion of the topic discussed in subsection (1.a),
above, obtain equally in the case of contrastive inversion of the topic. Those features common to both
types of inversion constructions are not given separate treatment in the present subsection. The exception is
a construction involving inversion of the topic of a clause following a pseudo—verb or pseudo—verb phrase
plus a linker (cf. §4.21). As is noted in subsection (1.a.5), the inverted topic in the ay-inversion
construction may cither precede or follow the pscudo—verb or pscudo—verb phrase. In contrastive
inversion, on the other hand, the topic always precedes the pseudo—verb. Thus:

kailangang
Sina Ben, magtanim ng gulay.

kailangan kong

‘It is necessary for
Ben and the others to plant vegetables.’
‘I need
but not:
*Kailangang
sina Ben, magtanim ng gulay.
Kailangan kong

Some further examples of contrastive—inversion constructions with initial adverbials are:

Para sa iyo, binili ko ito.
‘For you, I bought this,’

(cf. Binili ko ito para sa iyo.
‘I bought this for you.’)

Bago ka kumain, kailangan mong hugasan ang kamay mo.
‘Before you eat, you should wash your hands.”

(cf. Kailangan mong hugasan ang kamay mo bago ka kumain.
“You should wash your hands before you cat.’)

496 CHAPTER 7

(The same types of adverbials occur initially in contrastive inversion as in ay inversion — cf. (1), above.)

(3) EMPHATIC INVERSION Emphatic inversion involves the shifting to initial position of an
adverbial or a directional complement (cf. §2.13). Emphatic inversion differs formally from contrastive
inversion (cf. (2), above) in that the elements whose basic—sentence order is reversed are not separated
from one another by pause. From the point of view of meaning, emphatic inversion differs from contrastive
inversion in that only the initial element is given special semantic prominence. In some cases the initial
element is contrasted, either implicitly or explicitly, with some structurally similar clement in another
sentence; in other cases the initial element is merely emphasized, without any implication of contrast. Thus
a sentence like:

Dito magtatayo ng bahay si Juan.
‘It’s here that Juan will build a house.’

(cf. Magtatayo ng bahay si Juan dito.
‘Juan will build a house here.”)

may occur cither in a context such as:

Dito magtatayo ng bahay si Juan — hindi doon.
‘It’s here that Juan will build a house — not there.’

or in a context such as:

Dito magtatayo ng bahay si Juan. Maganda ang tanawin, ano?
‘It’s here that Juan will build a house. The view is beautiful, isn’t it?”

In emphatic inversion enclitic pronouns (cf. §3.29) follow the initial adverb or complement: ¢.g.,

Bukas ng gabi siya aalis.
“It’s tomorrow night that he’s leaving.’

(cf. Aalis siya bukas ng gabi.
‘He’s leaving tomorrow night.’)

Enclitic particles (cf. §6.6) may also follow the initial adverbial or complement, but may, if this initial
structure has two or more components, optionally follow one of the non-final components as well. Thus:

ng alas otso ng gabi daw
Bukas ng alas otso daw ng gabi siya aalis.

daw ng alas otso ng gabi
‘It’s tomorrow night at eight that he’s leaving, they say.”

(cf. Aalis daw siya bukas ng gabi ng alas otso.
‘He’s leaving tomorrow night at eight, they say.”)

As the translations of the above sentences show, sentences with emphatic inversion are often
equivalent to English sentences with ‘It’s... that’ (or ‘It was... that’). They may also be equivalent to
English sentences in which special pitch prominence is given to the word or phrase that translates the initial
element (the adverbial or complement) of the Tagalog structure. Thus, Dito magtatayo ng bahay si Juan
may be translated ‘Juan will build a house here’ as well as ‘It’s here that Juan will build a house.”

 
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 497

There are certain movable adverbs that do not occur initially in ay-inversion or contrastive—inversion
constructions (cf. subsection (1.b) above) but that do occur initially in emphatic—inversion constructions.
These are point—time adverbs that, in non-inverted position, consist of nang plus the name of a part of the
day. (Nang is, as usual, absent from the inverted construction.) Thus, for example:

siya aalis.
Umaga
aalis si Juan.

“He
will leave in the morning.’

‘Juan

siya

(cf. Aalis nang umaga.

si Juan

“He
will leave in the morning.’)
‘Juan

(The other movable adverbs mentioned in (1.b) above as failing to occur in ay inversion also fail to occur in

emphatic inversion. They occur, however, in non-emphatic inversion — cf. subsection (4) below.)
Some further examples of emphatic—inversion constructions with initial adverbials are:

Dahil sa iyo ako nahuli.
‘It was because of you that I was late.’

(cf. Nahuli ako dahil sa iyo.
“I was late because of you.’)

Para kay Pedro ba binili ng Nanay ang laruan?
‘Was it for Pedro that Mother bought the toy?’

(cf. Binili ba ng Nanay ang laruan para kay Pedro?
‘Did Mother buy the toy for Pedro?’)

Nang nakita ko siya ko napaghulo kung ano ang nangyari.
‘It’s when I saw him that I realized what had happened.’

(cf. Napaghulo ko kung ano ang nangyari nang nakita ko siya.
‘I realized what had happened when J saw him.’)

Some examples of emphatic—inversion constructions with initial directional complements are:

Sa kantong ito umaalis ang bus.
‘It’s this corner that the bus leaves from.’

(cf. Umaalis ang bus sa kantong ito.
‘The bus leaves from this corner.”)

‘He wrote to Maria.’)

Sa akin nila ibinigay ang premyo.
‘It’s me they gave the prize to.’

(cf. Ibinigay nila ang premyo sa akin.
‘They gave the prize to me.”)

Emphatic inversion may be combined with ay inversion or contrastive inversion in a single sentence or
clause, as in the following examples:

Kami’y dito kakain.
‘It’s here that we'll eat.” (formal style)

Kami, dito kakain.
‘It’s here that we'll cat.’

(cf. Kakain kami dito.
‘We'll eat here.”)

(4) NON-EMPHATIC INVERSION. Non-emphatic inversion involves the shifting of an adverbial to
initial position, and the insertion of the linker na/-ng immediately before the first word of the predicate.
The linker is optional where the initial element is a frequency adverb formed with beses or ulit (cf. §6.8,
subsection (I.g)), obligatory in all other cases. (Any enclitic pronouns or particles that constitute an
immediate part of the predicate or of the sentence as a whole — cf. §§3.29 and 6.6 — occur between the
initial adverbial and the linker. For a description of the linker na/-ng cf. §3.11.) Only a few types of
adverbials occur in non-emphatic inversion. These include manner adverbs (cf. §6.10) and a limited set of
time adverbs (cf. §6.8). (The time adverbs that occur in non-emphatic inversion are those that fail to occur
in inversion constructions of other types — cf. subsections (1.b) and (3), above.)

Non-emphatic inversion has no effect upon the meaning of a sentence. Some examples are:

Mabilis na lumalapit ang bagyo sa Maynila.
‘The storm is rapidly approaching Manila.”

(cf. Lumalapit ang bagyo sa Maynila nang mabilis.
‘The storm is rapidly approaching Manila.’)

Bigla nilang pinasok ang silid.
‘They suddenly entered the room”

(cf. Pinasok nila ang silid nang bigla.
‘They suddenly entered the room.’)

‘Manuel

‘He

si Manuel

(cf. Pumarito kahapon nang tatlong beses/ulit.
siya
‘Manuel came here three times yesterday.’)

Non-emphatic inversion may be combined with ay inversion, contrastive inversion, or emphatic
inversion in a single sentence or clause, as in the following examples:

Kaninang imag’y mabilis na nagtrabaho ang lahat.
‘Everyone worked quickly this morning.’ (formal style)

Kaninang umaga, mabilis na nagtrabaho ang lahat.
‘This morning, everyone worked quickly.”

Kaninang umaga mabilis na nagtrabaho ang lahat.
‘It was this morning that everyone worked quickly.”

(cf. Nagtrabaho ang lahat nang mabilis kaninang umaga.
“Everyone worked quickly this morning.’)

In emphatic or non-emphatic inversion, the negator hindi (cf. §7.13) precedes the inverted clement if
it is this element that is being negated; otherwise, hindi follows the inverted element. The placement of
hindi in the inverted construction resolves a potential ambiguity in the underlying non-inverted
construction. Some examples are:

Hindi doon pumunta si Juan.
‘It isn’t there that Juan went.”

Doon hindi pumunta si Juan.
“It’s there that Juan didn’t go.’

Hindi palaging nagsusumbrero si Juan.

Palaging hindi nagsusumbrero si Juan.
‘Juan always goes hatless.”
(Literally, ‘Juan always doesn’t wear a hat.’)

(cf. Hindi nagsusumbrero si Juang palagi.
doesn’t always

‘Juan wear a hat.’)
always doesn’t

Hindi never occurs initially in a construction involving ay inversion or contrastive inversion.

§7.3. Questions: introduction.

Tagalog questions may be divided into five classes, according to the types of answers they normally
elicit. These five classes are: YES-NO QUESTIONS; ALTERNATIVE QUESTIONS; CONFIRMATION
QUESTIONS; INFORMATION QUESTIONS; and PLEASE-REPEAT QUESTIONS. A YES-NO
QUESTION is a question to which the expected answer is some cquivalent of ‘yes’ or ‘no’: ¢.g.,

Pupunta ka ba?
‘Are you going?”
Oo. ‘Yes.’
(Expected answers: )
Hindi. ‘No.’

An ALTERNATIVE QUESTION is a question to which the expected answer is one of two or more
alternatives given in the question itself: e.g.,

Pupunta ka ba, o mamamalagi rito?

‘Are you going, or staying here?’
Pupunta ako. ‘I'm going.”

(Expected answers: )

Mamamalagi ako rito. ‘I'm staying here.’

A CONFIRMATION QUESTION is one to which the expected answer is assent to a proposition made by
the questioner: ¢.g.,

Pupunta ka, hindi ba?
‘You're going, aren’t you?”
(Expected answer: Oo. ‘Yes.’)

Elements sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 501

An INFORMATION QUESTION is one to which the expected answer is information that falls within a
semantic (and, to some extent, structural) category indicated by the questioner: ¢.g.,

Sino ang pupunta?

“Who’s going?’
Ikaw. “You.”
(Expected answers: { Si Juan. ‘Juan.’ 7)
etc.

A PLEASE-REPEAT QUESTION is one to which the expected answer is a complete or partial repetition
of something already said by the person addressed: e.g.,

Pupunta si Juan.
(Previous utterance:
‘Juan is going.)

Sino ‘kamo ang pupunta?
‘Who did you say is going?’

(Expected answer: Si Juan. ‘Juan.’)

These five classes of questions are presented below as follows: yes—no questions in §7.4; alternative
questions in §7.5; confirmation questions in §7.6; information questions in §§7.7 through 7.11; and
please—repeat questions in §7.12.

§7.4. Yes—no questions.

In English, yes—no questions are marked by a rising intonation pattern, by interrogative word order
(which consists in placing part of the predicate verb phrase before the subject), or, most often, by
both: ¢.g.,

— if

Are you going?

In Tagalog too, yes—no questions are marked by characteristic rising intonation patterns (cf. § §1.24, 1.26,
and 1.27, intonation patterns 1.3, III.3, and IV.4), but there is no special interrogative word order. Tagalog
does, however, have a second way of marking yes—no questions: namely, the inclusion in the question of
the enclitic particle ba, a word whose “meaning” is precisely this interrogative marking of a sentence in
which it occurs. (The uses of ba are summarized in §6.4, subsection (g); the position of ba in relation to
other sentence elements is discussed in § §6.2 and 6.6.)

Ba is optional in yes—no questions. Provided that the appropriate intonation is used, a yes—no
question is understood as such whether or not it includes ba. But in spite of its optionalness, ba actually
does occur in yes—no questions more often than not, especially when the question is a long one. (In a long
question, speakers evidently choose not to defer too long some indication that the question is in fact a
question. Ba, being an enclitic, occurs early in a sentence, while interrogative intonation in some cases
becomes unambiguous only in the last two syllables of a sentence.)

Any Tagalog statement may be converted into a yes—no question through the use of interrogative
intonation (reflected in conventional orthography by a question mark), and, optionally, the enclitic particle
ba. A few examples are:

Statement Question
Mabait si Pilar. Mabait (ba) si Pilar?
‘Pilar is kind.’ ‘Is Pilar kind?”

502 CHAPTER 7

Statement Question

May tubig sa baso. May tubig (ba) sa baso?

“There’s water in the glass.” ‘Is there water in the glass?’
Bumili ng karne ang Nanay. Bumili (ba) ng karne ang Nanay?
‘Mother bought some meat.” ‘Did Mother buy some meat?’

(Baga jbagah/ occurs as an alternant of ba in some dialect areas, but is not common in educated
Manila Tagalog.)

Most yes—no questions are answerable either by vo /’o’oh/ ‘yes) (or its polite variants, opo fo'po’/
and oho /’o-ho’/) or hindi /hindi’} ‘no’. Yes—no questions whose predicate is a possessive, existential, or
indefinite may(roon) phrase (cf. § §4.22 and 4.23), however, are normally answered by mayroon ‘yes’ or
wala ‘no.’ Thus:

Sa iyo ba ang bola? { Oo. at
‘Does the ball belong to you?” Hindi. ‘No.
but

{Mev bola ka ba? \
Mayroon ka bang bola?,
‘Do you have a ball?”

ier bola ba sa mesa? \ jane es.
Mayroon bang bola sa mesa? Wala. ‘No.’

‘Is there a ball on the table?”

iiss paglalaruan ba? \
Mayroon bang paglalaruan?

‘Is there something to play with?’

§7.5. Alternative questions.

The structure of Tagalog alternative questions is quite similar to that of English alternative questions.
In each language, most alternative questions are analyzable into two parts, the first of which is a normal
yes—no question (including normal interrogative intonation) and the second of which begins with an
ALTERNATIVE CONJUNCTION (‘or’ in English, o ‘or’ in Tagalog) and has statement intonation. Some
examples of alternative questions are:

Pilipino (ba) si Bob, o Amerikano?
‘Is Bob a Filipino, or an American?”

Gusto (ba) ninyo ng mangga, o papaya?
‘Do you want a mango, or a papaya?’

Magpapasyal (ba) tayo sa Dewey, o sa Luneta?
‘Shall we take a walk on Dewey, or in the Luneta?”

If more than two alternatives are given — ¢.g.,

Gusto (ba) ninyo ng mangga, papaya, © mansanas? —
‘Do you want a mango, a papaya, or an apple?"

the interrogative intonation pattern is repeated for each alternative but the last, which retains the statement
intonation.
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 503

O, like English ‘or,’ is also used in coordinate constructions. This use of o is discussed in §7.19,
subsection (2).

§7.6. Confirmation questions.

In English, confirmation questions (sometimes called TAG QUESTIONS) differ in form according to
whether the proposition to be confirmed is affirmative or negative, according to the tense or auxiliary of
the verb in the proposition to be confirmed, and according to the antecedent of the pronoun in the
confirmation question. Thus:

‘John worked, didn’t he?”
‘John didn’t work, did he?’
‘John’s working, isn’t he?’
“You worked, didn’t you?’

In Tagalog, the form of confirmation questions does not vary in these ways. Thus:

Nagtrabaho si John, ano?
‘John worked, didn’t he?’

Hindi nagtrabaho si John, ano?
‘John didn’t work, did he?”

Nagtatrabaho si John, ano?
‘John’s working, isn’t he?’

Nagtrabaho ka, ano?
‘You worked, didn’t you?’

Tagalog does, however, have a number of different formulas that are used in confirmation questions.
These formulas are: ano, dili nga ba’t, diyata’t, diyata, hindi ba’t, and hindi ba. The formulas may be
classified as follows, according to whether they follow the proposition to be confirmed, precede it, or may
occur in either position:

after the proposition: ano
before the proposition: dili nga ba’t, diyata’t, diyata, hindi ba’t
either position: hindi ba

Confirmation questions with ano (see examples above) consist of two intonation phrases. The
proposition to be confirmed takes a rising intonation pattern (pattern 1.3, §1.24), while ano itself takes a
low level intonation pattern (pattern 1.5, § 1.24).

Diyata and the three initial confirmation—question formulas ending in ‘¢ (which is a contraction of
at) are used in what may be called strong confirmation questions. Diyata't, diyata, and, for some speakers,
dili nga ba’t, ate used to introduce propositions of whose truth the speaker has just had evidence: e.g.,

Dili nga ba’t
Diyata’t magkakilala kayo?
Diyata,
‘Then you know one another?’

Hindi ba’t is used to introduce propositions whose truth is assumed to be obvious:

Hindi ba’t malamig sa Alaska?
‘Isn't it obvious that it’s cold in Alaska?’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur

eee eee...
504 CHAPTER 7

Some speakers also use dili nga ba’t in this sense.

Strong confirmation questions with diyata have the intonation of two juxtaposed yes—no questions
(cf. §7.4), with the first rise at the end of diyata, the second at the end of the sentence. Strong
confirmation questions that include ‘t have the intonation of a single yes--no question.

Hindi ba, which may occur either before or after the proposition to be confirmed, is similar in
meaning to ano. Examples of confirmation questions with hindi ba are:

Tkaw ang bunso, hindi a
Hindi ba, ikaw ang bunso?
*You’re the youngest child, aren’t you?’

Titser na si Maria, hindi ba
Hindi ba, titser na si Maria?
‘Maria’s a teacher now, isn’t she?”

Some speakers avoid using Aindi ba with proposition negated by hindi, always using ano under these
circumstances. Other speakers, however, use such sentences as:

Hindi ba, hindi pa titser si Maria?
‘Maria isn’t a teacher yet, is she?”

{Hindi pa titser si Maria, hindi tt

as well as:
Hindi pa titser si Maria, ano?

Hindi ba always takes a rising intonation pattern. When it precedes the proposition to be confirmed,
this proposition also takes a rising intonation pattern. Where hindi ba follows the proposition to be
confirmed, the proposition may cither take a rising intonation pattern or retain its normal statement
intonation.

In some cases, confirmation questions with initial hindi ba have the same form as negative yes—no
questions, only intonation clarifying the intended meaning. Thus,

Hindi ba umulan kahapon?

may mean either ‘It rained yesterday, didn’t it?” (confirmation question) or ‘Didn’t it rain yesterday?’
(yes—no question). In other cases, word order distinguishes the confirmation questions from the yes—no
questions. Thus:

Hindi ba, titser na si Maria?
‘Maria’s a teacher now, isn’t she?’
Hindi na ba titser si Maria?

‘Isn’t Maria a teacher now?”

(For a discussion of certain peculiarities in the use of 00 and hindi in answering negative confirmation
questions, cf. §7.13.)

§7.7. Information questions: introduction.

As was stated in §7.3, an information question is a question to which the expected answer is
information that falls within a semantic — and, to some extent, structural—category indicated by the
questioner. In Tagalog as in English, the category within which the expected information falls is indicated
by the use of one of a relatively small group of INTERROGATIVE WORDS: e.g., kailan ‘when’, nassan
‘where’, sino ‘who.’ The answer to a kailan question, for example, is normally a time adverbial, the answer

 
‘DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 505

to a nasaan question a locative adjectival, the answer to a sito question a nominal that represents a human
being.

From the point of view of grammatical function, as well as that of meaning, the several interrogative
words funtion as interrogative substitutes for the class of structures they normally elicit. Thus Kailan has
grammatical functions similar to those of such time expressions as ngayon ‘today’, sa Lunes ‘next Monday’,
or tuwing Sabado ‘every Saturday’ (cf. §7.8), and may occur as:

(1) a pseudo—predicate: e.g.,
Kailan ang miting?
‘When is the meeting?’

Ngayon
(cf. Sa lunes ang miting.
Tuwing Sabado

today.”
‘The meeting is ¢ next Monday.’ ? )
every Saturday.’

(2) an adverbial: e.g.,
Kailan siya mangingisda?
‘When will he go fishing?’

Ngayon
(cf. Sa Lunes siya mangingisda.
Tuwing Sabado

today.’
‘He will go fishing next Monday.” > )
every Saturday.”

Tagalog interrogative words gencrally occur at or near the beginning of sentences. In this position
they substitute for predicates or pseudo—predicates, as in the first example above, or for adverbs occurring

initially in emphatic inversion constructions (cf. §7.2, subsection (3)), as in the second. Interrogative words
occasionally occur in other sentence positions — ¢.g., non-cmphatic adverb position:

Mangingisda siya kailan?
(cf. Mangingisda siya ngayon.)

Sentences with interrogative words in such positions are, however, at least as uncommon as their English
equivalents: ¢.g., ‘He'll go fishing when?’ (The English sentence, with appropriate intonation, might be
used as a response indicative of surprise. The Tagalog sentence would generally indicate only that the
speaker had decided to ask a question after the sentence had begun.)

Any Tagalog interrogative word may be accompanied, optionally, by the interrogative enclitic particle
ba. Thus:

Kailan (ba) siya mangingisda?

Regardless of the presence or absence of ba, information questions have their own characteristic intonation
patterns (patterns 1.1, 11.1, and III.3, presented in § § 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26 respectively), which differ from
those of yes—no questions.

Just as most English interrogative words have partially similar phonemic shapes (i.e., most of them
begin with /hw/, indicated in conventional English spelling by wi), so do most Tagalog interrogative words,
all except bakit ‘why’ and Aamusta ‘how’ having an /n/ in the last syllable. An alphabetical listing of the
Tagalog interrogative words, with their phonemic shapes and frequent English equivalents, follows:

alin [alin] ‘which’

ano [’anoh/ ‘what’

bakit {ba-kit/ ‘why’

kailan {ka’ilan/ ‘when’

kanino /kani‘noh/ ‘whose, who(m)’

kumusta /kumustah/ ‘how (qualityy

gaano /ga’a‘noh/ ‘how much (quantity)’

ilan [ilan/ ‘how many’

magkano /magka‘noh/ ‘how much (price)’

nakanino {na‘kani‘noh/ ‘with whom’ '
nasaan /na‘sa’an/ ‘where (location)’ |
nino {ni-noh/ ‘whose, who(m)’

paano /pa’anoh/ ‘how (manner)’

saan {sa’anj ‘where (direction)’

sino {si-noh/ ‘who(m)’

Each of the Tagalog interrogative words except bakit, Kumusta, and nasaan is pluralizable. The plural
formations are used optionally if the questioner anticipates a plural answer. Except in the case of nakanino, |
the plurals are formed by duplicating the first two syllables of the singular (or the entire singular if it is
disyllabic); the duplicating syllables precede the full form of the interrogative. The pluralized form of f
nakanino, which does not conform to these rules, is nakani-kanino. Inherent length, if any, is retained in
the duplicating syllables. In the case of the second duplicating syllable of kai-kailan /ka’i-ka’ilan/, length is
added (cf. kailan /ka’ilan/). The following is a list of nonpluralized and pluralized interrogative words, with

phonemic transcriptions of the latter:

alin > alin-alin /’alin’alin/

ano > anu-ano /’anu’anoh/

kailan > kai-kailan /ka’i-ka’ilan/

kanino > kani-kanino /kani*kani‘noh/

gaano > gaa-gaano /ga’aga’a‘noh/

ilan > ilan-ilan /’ilan’ilan/

magkano > magka-magkanoh /magka‘magka‘noh/
nakanino > nakani-kanino /nakani‘kani‘noh/ :
nino > ninu-nino /ni‘nuni‘noh/

paano >

saan > saan-saan /sa’ansa’an/

sino > sinu-sino /si‘nusi‘noh/

The uses of the various interrogative words of Tagalog are presented in detail in the immediately
following sections: uses of ano and alin in §7.8; uses of sino, nino, kanino, and nakanino in §7.9; uses of

paa-paano /pa’a‘pa’a‘noh/
nasaan, bakit, kailan, and saan in §7.10; and uses of kumusta, paano, gaano, ilan, and magkano in §7.11.

§7.8. Uses of ano and alin.
Ano ‘what’ is the most versatile of all the Tagalog interrogative words. It may serve as the |
interrogative substitute for any of the following: an unmarked noun; an adjective; the base of a ma-
adjective; a verb base. |
|
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 507

As a substitute for an unmarked noun, ano frequently occurs as the predicate of an equational
sentence: ¢.g.,

Ano iyon?
‘What's that?”

Ano ba siya? Duktor?
‘What’s he? A doctor?’

Ano ba ang punong-lunsod ng Pilipinas?
‘What's the capital of the Philippines?”

Ano ang binili mo?
‘What did you buy?”

Like the nouns for which it substitutes, ano may be definitized by a preceding ang (cf. §7.17): eg.,

Ang ano ba ang nasunog?
“What was the thing that got bummed?’

Ano may also serve as the interrogative substitute for an unmarked noun within a variety of adjectival
or adverbial phrases: e.g.,

Dahil sa ano siya namatay?
‘What did he die (because) of?’

May ano ka ba?
“What have you got?’

Nasa ano na ba ang pusa?
“What’s the cat on now?”

Nasa hilaga ng ano ang Estados Unidos?
‘What’s the United States north of?”

Para sa ano ba ito?
“What's this for?’

Sa ano mo ibabalot ang regalo?
‘What will you wrap the gift in?”

Tungkol sa ano ang kuwento?
“What’s the story about?’

Ano does not ordinarily replace a noun within a time adverb — Xailan ‘when’, which replaces the entire
phrase, being used instead; and certain of the above examples, although grammatical, are less usual than
would be the appropriate interrogative substitutes for the entire adjectival or adverbial phrases (cf. §7.10).
Thus bakit ‘why’ is more common than dahil sa ano ‘because of what’, nasaan ‘where’ than nasa ano ‘on/in
what’, etc.

508 CHAPTER 7

As an interrogative substitute for an adjective, ano may be used either as a predicate or as a
modifier: e.g.,

Ano ba ang panahon ngayon?
‘What's the weather (like) today?”

Anong panahon ang gusto mo?
‘What (kind of) weather do you like?’

When ano is used as a modifier, it always precedes the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11). Thus there is
no: “panahong ano.

As a modifier ano may serve as a substitute for a noun as well as an adjective. The noun that ano
replaces may occur in one of several different modification or compound constructions, but the
construction with ano is always of the shape ano + linker + head. Thus:

punong-mangga anong puno
“mango tree’ ‘what tree”
bayan ng Maynila anong bayan
‘city of Manila’ ‘what city”
Abenida Rizal anong abenida
‘Rizal Avenue’ “what avenue’

Among the common modification constructions that include ano are: anong Klase and anong uri
‘what kind,’ both of which may be followed either by ang phrase or by the linker -ng, and anong oras ‘what
time,” which functions as the interrogative counterpart of an expression of clock time (cf. §4.4, subsection
(6), and §6.8). Examples of these constructions are:

uri ng
uring
Ano bang selyo ang kailangan mo?
Klaseng
klase ng
‘What kind of stamp do you need?’

Anong oras siya dumating?
“What time did he arrive?’

As a substitute for the base of a ma- adjective, ano may occur in most of the same expanded

constructions as the ma- adjective bases themselves: e.g., the intensified construction with napaka- (cf.
§4.12) and the duplicated moderative construction (cf. §4.13). Thus:

Maano sila?
‘What are they (like)?’

Napakaano nila?
‘What are they very much (like)?’

Maanu-ano sila?
‘What are they rather (like)?’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 509

(Note that, while anu-ano is a plural formation — see §7.7 — maanu-ano is moderative. The plural of maano
is maaano, which follows the rules for the pluralization of ma- adjectives — cf. §4.11.)

As a substitute for a verb base, ano may occur with any verbal affix and in any one of the verbal
aspects. The verbs formed with ano have the same focus (or the same range of focuses) as other verbs
formed with the given affix (cf. Chapter 5). Some examples are:

AF: Nag-ano )
ka ba? “What did you do?”
Umano {
Nang-ano ka ba? ‘What did you do?’*
Naano ka? ‘What happened to you?’
OF: Inano mo ba ito? ‘What did you do with this?”
Iniano mo ba ito? ‘What did you do to this?’
DF: Inanuhan mo ito? ‘What did you do in/on this?’
BF: Iniano
mo ba siya? “What did you do for him?’
Ipinag-ano
CF: Ikinaano mo ba ito? ‘What did this cause you to do?:
IF: Ipinang-ano mo ito? ‘What did you use this to do?’

In addition to its uses as an interrogative word, ano has several other uses. The use of ano in
confirmation questions is discussed in §7.6, in exclamations in §4.24. Ano is also used as an indefinite
substitute for a word the speaker cannot remember, equivalent to English ‘thingamabob,’ ‘thingamajig,’
‘whatsisname,’ etc. For example:

Nasira ang ano sa kamera.
‘The thingamabob on the camera is broken.’

Nasaan si ano?
“Where’s whatsisname?’”

(The word Auwan is an equally common indefinite substitute of this type.) Finally, ano occurs as an
exclamation of mild surprise, mild annoyance, ctc., similar in meaning to certain uses of ‘well’: ¢.g.,

Ano, kumusta?
“Well, hello there.”

Ano, hindi ka pa ba pumapasok?
‘Well, haven’t you gone to work yet?”

*MANG-ANO, like certain other mang verbs (cf. §5.16), carries an implication of destructive and/or multiple action.

510 CHAPTER 7

Alin ‘which’ has somewhat the same distribution as the interrogative ano, occurring as a substitute for
an unmarked noun or an adjective. Alin differs in meaning from ano in much the same way that English
‘which’ differs from ‘what’: namely, alin elicits a choice between specific alternatives, either stated or
implied, while ano may elicit any response whatever that falls within the appropriate semantic and
grammatical category. Alin has a somewhat narrower range of meanings than ‘which,’ however, since it is
not normally used in reference to a human being, sino (cf. §7.9) being used instead in such sentences as:

Sino si Pedro, ang matangkad o ang pandak?
“Which is Pedro, the tall one or the short one?”

Sinong propesor ang magsasalita?
‘Which professor will speak?”

Sino sa mga bata ang pinakamatanda?
‘Which of the children is the oldest?’

Like ano, alin in predicate position may be preceded by ang. The use or non-use of ang before alin
seems to involve no change of meaning, since alin itself expresses considerable definiteness. Thus:

Alin
ang nasunog?

Ang alin
‘Which the thing that burned?’

Alin
ba ang punong-lunsod ng Pilipinas, ang Maynila o ang Quezon?
Ang alin
‘Which is the capital of the Philippines, Manila or Quezon?

When alin is used as a modifier, it always precedes the linker:

(Ang) aling bahay ang inyo?
‘Which house is yours?’

Sa aling parti ka ba pupunta?
‘Which party are you going to?’

Nasa aling kalye ang simbahan?
‘Which street is the church on?’

As an alternative to an attributive construction of the shape alin + linker + head, there is a
construction in which alin is followed by asa phrase (usually explicitly pluralized) that expresses the group
from which a choice is to be made. This construction is similar to the English ‘which of construction. For
example:

Alin sa mga bahay ang inyo?
‘Which of the houses is yours?’

Alin ba sa tatlong maleta ang pinakamabigat?
‘Which of the three bags is the heaviest?’

|

 
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES sil

This sa-phrase construction is the only one that occurs where the group from which a choice is to be made
is expressed by a deictic. Thus:

Alin sa mga ito ang mas gusto nila?
“Which of these do they like best?”

but not:
*Aling ito ang mas gusto nila?

§7.9. Uses of sino, nino, kanino, and nakanino.
Sino ‘who, whom’ is the interrogative substitute for an ang-form personal pronoun, si plus a personal

noun, or an ang phrase that represents a specific human being:

Ikaw?
gumawa noon?
Sino ba ang Si Pedro?
tinanong niya?
Ang abogado?,
You?’
‘Who did that?
Pedro?’
‘Who(m) did he ask?
The lawyer?’

As was mentioned in §7.8, sino, rather than alin, is used as the equivalent of an English ‘which’ that
refers to a specific human being. In this use, sino may occur as a modifier, followed by the linker na/-ng:

Sinong babae ang pinakamaganda?
‘Which woman is the prettiest?”

Nino, kanino, and nakanino are, respectively, the na, sa and nasa counterparts of sino. Some examples
of their use are:

Libro nino ito?
“Whose book is this?”

Kanino ba ang librong ito?
‘Who does this book belong to?”

Nakanino ang libro?
“Who's got the book?”

Nino is most frequently used as an interrogative substitute for a possessive ng phrase (cf. §3.20) as
illustrated above. It also occurs in various adjectival and adverbial phrases: e.g.,

Nasa tabi nino si Rudy?
‘Who is Rudy next to?’

Sa harap ba nino nakaupo si Rudy?
‘Who is Rudy sitting in front of?’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
$12 CHAPTER 7

Nino occasionally occurs as the interrogative substitute for a ng-phrase actor with a goal—focus verb:

Ginawa nino ang sapatos na iyon?
“Who made those shoes?”

Far more often, however, where the actor is being questioned, it is expressed by sino in predicate position,
a nominalized actor—focus verb (cf. §3.24) appearing in topic position:

Sino ang gumawa ng sapatos na iyon?
‘Who made those shoes?’

Kanino (which, for some speakers, has an alternative form kangino /kani‘noh/) is the interrogative
substitute for any sa phrase expressing a specific human being. (Unlike the sa-form personal pronouns, the
interrogative kanino replaces the entire sa phrase, including sa itself. But cf.§7.18 for the optional use of sa
before an indefinite expression involving kanino.) Further examples of its uses are:

Kanino mo ibinigay ang pera?
‘Who did you give the money to?’

Para kanino ba ang regalo?
‘Who is the present for?”

Ayon daw kanino darating siya bukas?
“According to whom is he coming tomorrow?’

Kanino is also used as a possessive modifier, with the linker na/-ng. For example:

Kaninong sombrero iyan?
“Whose hat is that?’

(The kanino and nino possessive—modifier constructions are equally common.)

Nakanino, like the nasa + human noun constructions for which it is a substitute (cf. §4.19), differs in
meaning according to whether the topic with which it occurs represents an object or a person. In the former
case, nakanino means ‘in whose possession’; in the latter case, it means ‘in whose care’ or ‘at whose place.’

Nakanino ba ang kotse?
“Who’s got the car?”

Nakanino ba ang sanggol?
“Who's looking after the baby?’

§7.10. Uses of nasaan, bakit, kailan, and saan.

The four interrogative words to be presented in this section all function as substitutes for
phrases: adjectival phrases in the case of nasaan; adverbial phrases in the case of bakit and Kailan; and
adjectival, adverbial, or directional—-complement phrases in the case of saan. All of them except Kailan
alternate with phrases that include ano (cf. §7.8): nasaan with nasa ano; bakit with dahil sa ano; and saan
with sa ano. The one—word interrogatives are more often used than the ano phrases.

Nasaan ‘where’ is the interrogative counterpart of an adjectival nasa phrase (cf. §4.19), except where
the noun in the phrase represents a human being, in which case nakanino is used (cf. §7.9). Examples of

DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES $13

the use of nasaan ate:

Nasaan ba ang makinilya ko?
‘Where is my typewriter?’

Nasaan si Pedro?
‘Where is Pedro?”

The phrase saan naroon occurs as a free alternant of nasaan:

Saan naroon si Pedro?
‘Where is Pedro?’

Bakit ‘why’ is the interrogative counterpart of a dahil sa causative adverb (cf. §6.11, subsection
(1.b)):

Bakit ba siya umuwi?
‘Why did he go home?’

Bakit mo sinulat iyong liham?
‘Why did you write that letter?’

Kailan ‘when’ is the interrogative counterpart of various time adverbs, including time adverbs used as
pseudo—predicates (cf. §6.8):

Kailan ba ang tag-ulan?
‘When is the rainy season?’

Kailan ka pupunta sa Maynila?
‘When are you going to Manila?”

Mula kailan siya nagtrabaho?
‘Since when has he been working?’

Hanggang kailan ka ba mamamalagi rito?
‘Until when will you remain here?’

(Specific times of day may be questioned by the ano phrase anong oras ‘what time’ (cf. §7.8):

Anong oras na?
‘What time is it now?’)

Saan ‘where’ may substitute for various types of sa phrases: ¢.g., possessive sa phrases (cf. §4.22),
directional complements (cf. §2.13), and locative adverbs (cf. §6.9). (Kanino is, however, used instead of
saan as the interrogative counterpart of a sa phrase that refers to a human being — cf. §7.9). Some
examples of the use of saan are:

Saan ba ang mesa?
‘Where does the table belong?’

Taga-saan ka ba?
“Where are you from?’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur

rrr err sect ieee
$14 CHAPTER 7

Saan ka pupunta?
‘Where are you going?’

Buhat saan ang mga talabang ito?
‘Where are these oysters from?”

Saan ba nangingisda ang mga lalaki?
‘Where do the men go fishing?’

Both saan and nasaan may be used as modifiers, in which case they are linked to the rest of the
modification construction by the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11):

Nasaan bang aparador ang mga panyolito?
“Which dresser are the handkerchiefs in?’

Saan daw na lugar sila magbabakasyon?
“Which place did they say they'll vacation in?’

The saan naroon alternant of nasaan, however, is preferred to nasaan itself in modification constructions.
Where saan naroon is used as 3 modifier, the linker na/-ng follows saan, while naroon follows the word or
construction that saan naroon modifies:

Saang maliit na kahon naroon ang singsing?
‘Which little box is the ring in?’

§7.11. Uses of kumusta, paano, gaano, ilan, and magkano.

Kumusta, paano, and gaano are all translatable by English ‘how’ (gaano sometimes by ‘how much’ as
well — see below). Kumusta, which is derived from Spanish cdmo estd ‘how is’, is used as the interrogative
substitute for an adjective of quality: ¢.g.,

Kumusta ba ang ani? Malaki?
‘How is the harvest? Big?’

It is also used as a conventional greeting (cf. §7.22), with or without a second—person pronoun:

ka
Kumusta ?
kayo

‘How are you?”

(Some speakers pronounce Aurmusta /kamustah/, but /kumustah/ is probably the standard pronunciation in
Manila.)

Paano is the interrogative counterpart of a pa- adjective or adverb of manner (cf. § §4.7 and 6.10).
Used adverbially, paano is optionally but preferably followed by the linker na/-ng. As the first clement of
an adjective—plus—basic--form—complement construction (cf. §4.17), paano is optionally but preferably
followed by the linker -ng or the particle kung. Some examples of uses of paano are:

Paano ang lakad niya?
‘How does he walk?”

Paano raw (na) nakarating ang mga Cruz?
‘How did they say the Cruzes came?’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 515

Paano mo ba(ng) sinasabi iyon sa Inggles?
‘How do you say that in English?’

siya(ng)
Paano magsayaw?

siya kung
‘How does he dance?’ (‘in what manner?’)

Gaano occurs as the interrogative counterpart of ganirc, ganito, ganyan, and ganoon before a
formation consisting of ka- plus an adjective base (cf. §4.18), in constructions that are equivalent to
English ‘how’—plus—adjective and ‘how’—plus—adverb constructions: e.g., ‘how big,” ‘how far,” ‘how fast.’
As in the case of ganire, etc., some speakers usc the linker -ng before the ka- formation while others do not.
Some examples are:

Gaano(ng) kalayo ang ilog?
‘How far is the river?”

Gaano ba(ng) kahinog ang prutas?
‘How ripe is the fruit?’

Gaano(ng) kabilis tumakbo si Juan?
‘How fast does Juan run?”

Gaano(ng) kabuti siyang nagsalita ng Tagalog?
‘How well did he speak Tagalog?”

Duplicated plurals of adjective bases may occur in the gaano(ng) ka- construction, as in constructions
with ganire(ng) ka-, etc.: ¢.g.,

Gaano(ng) katatanda ang mga anak mo?
‘How old are your children?’

Gaano ba(ng) kamamahal ang mga bulaklak na ito?
‘How expensive are these flowers?”

Gaano is also used as an interrogative quantifier, equivalent to English ‘how much." In this use it may
occur as predicate opposite a mass—noun topic or referring to an implied mass noun, or as a modifier of a
mass noun, (Cf. §3.9 for a discussion of the distinction between mass and count nouns.) When it is used as
a modifier, gaano is followed by the linker na/-ng. Some examples of the use of the interrogative quantifier
gaano are:

Gaano ang natitirang adobo?
‘How much adobo is left?’
(Literally: ‘How much is the remaining adobo?’)

Gaano ba ang kailangan mo?
‘How much do you need?”

Gaanong tela ang binili niya?
‘How much cloth did he buy?”

Gaano raw na asukal ang dapat kong ilagay sa kaniyang kape?
‘How much sugar did he say I should put in his coffee?’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
516 CHAPTER 7

fan is the count—noun counterpart of the quantifier gaano, and is equivalent to English ‘how many.’
Like gaano, it may be used as a predicate or as a modifier:

Ilan ba kayo?
‘How many are you?’

Ilang selyo ang kailangan ninyo?
‘How many stamps do you need?’

(For a discussion of the uses of gaano and ilan as limiters, cf. §3.22.)

Magkano, like gaano, is translatable by English ‘how much.’ Magkano, however, refers to price rather
than to quantity. It has a distributive form, involving duplication of the second syllable — magkakano
/magkaka‘noh/ — which is translatable by English ‘how much each’ or ‘how much apiece.’ Some examples
of the use of magkano and magkakano are:

Magkano ba ang pasahe?
‘How much is the fare?’

Magkakano iyang bayabas?
‘How much each are those guavas?” |

Magkanong bigas ang bibilhin ko?
‘How much shall I spend on rice?”
(Literally: ‘How much (worth of) rice shall | buy?’)

§7.12. Please—repeat questions.

A please—repeat question is, as was noted in §7.3, a question to which the expected answer is a
complete or partial repetition of something already said by the person addressed. Please—repeat questions
always carry a /2t/ intonation pattern (pattern 1.3, § 1.24). This pattern differs from the patterns carried
by information questions (/34/, /334/, and /314/ — respectively patterns 1.1 (§ 1.24), II.1 (1.25), and 11.3
(1.26)). The question particle ba is not used in please—repeat questions.

The most common way of requesting a complete repetition of something said by the person
addressed is simply:

This may be extended in various ways: ¢.g.,

sinabi

mo?
Ano ang sabi

wika
“What did you say?’

In informal contexts, one may also say:

Ha?
“Huh?”

i
Ano?
‘What?’
!
|

 
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 517

Questions that ask for a partial repetition of something said by the person addressed may begin with
any interrogative word (cf. §7.7), the choice depending upon the particular item the speaker wants
tepeated. Thus, if the person with whom one is speaking has said:

Kakanta si Rosa sa iskwela mamayang gabi.
‘Rosa is singing at school tonight.’

one might ask any of the following please—repeat questions:

Aano siya (sa iskwela mamayang gabi)?

‘What is she doing (at school tonight)?’

Sino (ang kakanta sa iskwela mamayang gabi)?
‘Who (is singing at school tonight)?’

Saan (siya kakanta mamayang gabi)?
‘Where (is she singing tonight)?”

Kailan (siya kakanta sa iskwela)?
“When (is she singing at school)?’

The contracted quotation tags ‘kano and ‘kaninyo (cf. §3.28, subsections (1.d) and (2.d)) are of
fairly frequent occurrence in please—repeat questions. They do not occur initially in such questions, but
may occur either medially or finally. Thus:

*kamo ang kakanta?
Sino

ang kakanta, "kamo?

did you say is singing?’
‘Who

is singing, did you say?
(Cf. the yes—no questions:

‘Kamo, “Sino ang kakanta?”
‘Did you say/ask, “Who is singing?” *)

§7.13. Negation with hindi and di.

Tagalog has at least seven negators. Listed in approximate order of frequency, they are: hindi (and its
contraction, di), wala, huwug, ayaw, aywan, dili, and ni. The uses of these negators are presented in this and
the immediately following sections: hindi and di in the present section; wala in §7.14; huwag in §7.15;
ayaw, aywan, dili, and ni in §7.16.

Hindi is the most common and versatile of the Tagalog negators. It is used to negate a great variety of
constructions: all constructions, in fact, that are not specifically enumerated in § §7.14 through 7.16.

Hindi may occur in either the predicate or the topic. It is followed by the word or phrase that it
negates, either directly or after one or more enclitics. Some examples of the use of hindi are:

Hindi biro ang buhay.
‘Life isn’t a joke.”

Hindi tama iyon.
‘That isn’t right.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
518 CHAPTER 7

Hindi raw siya para kay Gomez.
‘They say he isn’t for Gomez.’

Hindi ngayon ang miting.
‘The meeting isn’t today.’

Hindi dumating ang bus.
‘The bus didn’t come.’

Hindi pa dumarating ang bus.
‘The bus hasn’t come yet.’

Hindi raw darating ang bus.
‘They say the bus won’t come.”

Ang hindi matatalino ang tinuturuan niya.
‘The ones he teaches are the unintelligent ones.

Mayroon ba kayong hindi pa hinog?
‘Do you have any that aren’t ripe yet?”

Gumagawa siya ng mga hindi mahal.
‘He makes inexpensive ones.’

Ginagawa niya ang mga hindi mahal.
‘He makes the inexpensive ones.”

Walang ginagawa ang mga hindi mangingisda.
‘The ones who aren’t fishermen have nothing to do.’

As the above examples show, hindi is often translatable by English ‘not/n’t,’ sometimes translatable
by negative prefixes like ‘un-’ or ‘in-.” To express the equivalent of English negative adverbs like ‘never’ or
‘nowhere’ (or their two—word counterparts ‘not... ever,’ ‘not... anywhere’), Tagalog uses hindi (or, in
the appropriate constructions, wala or /uwag) plus an indefinite adverbial construction with kahit and/or

man (cf. §7.18):

kahit kailan(man).
Hindi siya sumusulat sa akin

kailanman.
‘He never writes to me.’

kahit saan(man).
Hindi mura ang karne

saanman,
‘Meat isn’t cheap anywhere.’

(Note, however:

Wala siyang panahon kahit kailan.
‘He never has time.’

Huwag kang pumunta saanman.
‘Don’t go anywhere.’)

When hindi is used to negate an ability verb (cf. §5.13), the basic form of the verb may occur asa
free alternant of the imperfective form. Thus:

nakakapagsalita

Hindi ang bata.
makapagsalita

‘The child can’t speak.’
naiinom

Hindi ng bata ang gamot.
mainom

‘The child can’t swallow the medicine.’

(If the verb is not an ability verb, the basic form is not used in this way. Thus there is no:
*Hindi magsalita ang bata.

occurring as an alternant of:

Hindi nagsasalita ang bata.
‘The child doesn’t speak.)

In addition to its uses in negating a following word or phrase, hindi — plus, optionally, one or more
enclitic particles other than ba — occurs as the short negative answer to all ‘yes—no’ questions except those
few answered negatively by wala (cf. §7.14). Hindi in short answers is roughly equivalent to English ‘no,’
and is the negative counterpart of oo ‘yes.’ In answer to yes—no questions and affirmative confirmation
questions (cf. §§7.4 and 7.6), the correspondence of hindi and oo to ‘no’ and ‘yes’ respectively is quite
close:

Darating (ba) si Pedro?
‘Is Pedro coming?”
Hindi. ‘No. (He isn’t coming.)’

Hindi (ba) darating si Pedro?
‘Isn’t Pedro coming?”
Oo. ‘Yes. (He’s coming.)’

Darating si Pedro, ano?
*Pedro’s coming, isn’t he?’

In answer to negative confirmation questions, however, hindi and oo correspond more closely to English
“you're wrong’ and ‘you're right’ respectively:

Hindi. ‘You're wrong. (He's coming.)’
Hindi darating si Pedro, ano?
‘Pedro isn’t coming, is he?”

Oo. “You're right. (He isn’t coming.)’

(Frequently, however, the negative reply to a negative confirmation question is not hindi. Thus:

Elements sous droits d'auteur
 

520 CHAPTER 7

Hindi darating si Pedro, ano?
“Pedro isn’t coming, is he?’

Darating.
‘(He’s) coming.’)

Hindi also occurs in the confirmation—question formulas hindi ba and hindi ba’t, as in:

{Pinas ba, dumarating na si Pedor}
Dumarating na si Pedro, hindi ba?
‘Pedro’s coming now, isn’t he?’

Hindi ba’t malamig sa Alaska?
“Isn't it obvious that it’s cold in Alaska?”

(For a detailed discussion of confirmation questions, cf. §7.6.)

(An intensified form of hindi, hinding-hindi ‘not at all, certainly not,” etc., occurs in most of the same
contexts as hindi itself. The intensified form, however, does not occur before ba or ba’t in confirmation
questions.)

(For a treatment of limiters that include hindi — hindi (Ka)kaunti and hindi gagaano ‘quite a lot,
hindi gaano ‘not much,’ and hindi iilan ‘quite a few’ — cf. §3.22.)

A contracted form of hindi, di, occurs as a free alternant of hindi in a number of different
constructions, among them:

a. in yes—no questions:

‘Haven’t you written to Maria yet?’

b. in initial confirmation—question formulas:

‘Isn’t it obvious that I’ve done that already.’

c. before comparisons of equality (cf. §4.14):
Hindi

‘Aurora isn’t as pretty as Rosa.”
d. after kung, (ka}pag(ka), and certain other subordinating conjunctions:

§7.14. Negation with wala.

Wala is the negative counterpart of mayroon and may, and of the na- that occurs in locative nasa
phrases. As the negative counterpart of mayroon and may, wala replaces these words in all the
constructions in which they occur: possessive (cf. §4.22); indefinite and existential (cf. §4.23); and short
answers or questions. (Both mayroon and may occur in possessive, indefinite and existential constructions,
only mayroon in a short answer or question.)

In possessive, indefinite, and existential constructions, wala, like mayroon (and unlike may), is
normally followed by the linker -ng. (The linker follows wala directly if there are no enclitic particles
and/or pronouns present, but follows the enclitics themselves if any occur. In possessive constructions, if
the thing possessed is expressed by a deictic pronoun, the mg form of the deictic is used after wala as after
mayroon), with no linker occurring between wala and the dcictic. Wala translates English ‘doesn’t/don’t

have (any)’ in possessive constructions, ‘there isn’t/aren’t (any)’ in existential constructions. Some examples
are:

Affirmative Negative

May pera si Mr. Ruiz. > Walang pera si Mr. Ruiz.

‘Mr. Ruiz has money.’ Mr. Ruiz doesn’t have any money.”
Mayroon ka bang kotse? > Wala ka bang kotse?

‘Do you have a car?” ‘Don’t you have a car?’

May singsing sa daliri niya. > Walang singsing sa daliri niya.
‘There’s a ring on his finger.” ‘There isn’t any ring on his finger.’
Mayroon ngang bahay doon. > Wala ngang bahay doon.

‘There really is a house there.’ ‘There really isn’t a house there.’

Indefinite constructions with wala are usually equivalent to English constructions with ‘no
one/not . .. anyone,’ ‘nothing/not . . . anything,” or ‘nowhere/not . . . anywhere.’ Some examples are:

Affirmative Negative

Mayroon akong dadalawin ngayon. > Wala akong dadalawin ngayon.
‘I have no one

‘I have someone to visit today.’ to visit today.’
‘I don’t have anyone

May dumating kahapon. > Walang dumating kahapon.

‘Someone came yesterday.’ ‘No one came yesterday.’

“Jose is doing something.” ‘Jose

‘Something happened this morning.’ ‘Nothing happened this morning.’
Mayroon kaming pupun tahan. > Wala kaming pupuntahan.
have nowhere
“We have somewhere to go.” ‘We to go.”
don’t have anywhere

The wala possessive and existential constructions may be intensified to express meanings like ‘doesn’t
have any ...at all,’ ‘there isn’t any...at all,” provided that the word following the linker -ng is an
unmarked noun. In the intensified construction, the linker is followed by the prefix ka- /ka/, which is in
turn followed by a duplicating prefix, then by the (underlying) noun. In the case of monosyllabic
underlying nouns, the duplicating prefix is identical with the noun (except that a final /’/ or /h/ in the noun
does not appear in the prefix). In the case of longer underlying nouns, the formation of the duplicating
prefix follows the rules given for dup,- in §5.16. Some examples of intensified wala constructions are:

Wala akong katsok-tsok. /kat$o°ktSo°k/
‘I don’t have any chalk at all.’

Wala akong katsa-tsa. /kat$a‘t8a"h/
‘I don’t have any tea at all.”

Wala akong kapera-pera. /kape‘rape:rah/
‘I don’t have any money at all.”

Wala akong kadamit-damit. /kadamitdamit/
‘I don’t have any clothes at all.”

Wala akong katina-tinapay. /katina‘tina*pay/
‘I don’t have any bread at all.’

Wala akong katsoko-tsokolate. /katSoko:tSokola:teh/
‘I don’t have any chocolate at all.’

As the negative counterpart of na- in locative nasa phrases (cf. §4.19), wala translates English
‘isn’t/aren’t in/on,’ etc. Examples are:

Affirmative Negative

Nasa tokador ang kamisadentro. ad Wala sa tokador ang kamisadentro.
‘The shirt is in the dresser.” ‘The shirt isn’t in the dresser.’

Nasa ilalim ng silya ang mga pusa. > Wala sa ilalim ng silya ang mga pusa.
‘The cats are under the chair.’ ‘The cats aren’t under the chair.’
Nasa kaniya ba ang manyika? > Wala ba sa kaniya ang manyika?
‘Does she have the doll?’ “Doesn’t she have the doll?”

Narito na ang Nanay. > Wala na rito ang Nanay.

‘Mother is here now.” ‘Mother isn’t here now.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 523

(Note that, as in the last two examples, any enclitics directly follow wala.)

Wala (plus, optionally, one or more enclitic particles other than ba) occurs as a negative short answer
to a question beginning with may, mayroon, or wala itself:

May itatanong ka ba? Wala.

‘Do you have anything to ask?” ‘No.’

Mayroon ba kayong bigas? Wala po.

“Do you have any rice?” ‘No, sir.”

Wala rito si Bob? Wala pa raw.

‘Isn’t Bob here?” ‘They say he isn’t yet.’

With ba (plus, optionally, one or more other enclitic particles), wala is used in short questions to mean
‘isn’t/aren’t there any?”: ¢.g.,

Humahanap ako ng gatas. Wala (na) ba?
‘I'm looking for some milk. Isn’t there any (more)?”

(There is an intensified form of wala, walang-wala ‘doesn’t/don’t have any ... at all’ etc., which
occurs in most of the same contexts as wala itself.)

§7.15. Negation with huwag.

Huwag expresses a negative desire. It has two main uses: to negate imperatives, hortatives and
optatives (cf. §5.30); and to add the meaning of negative desire to statements. In constructions of both
types, Auway is frequently followed by one or more enclitic particles and/or pronouns, Under these
circumstances, the linker -ng (cf. §3.11) normally precedes the first non-enclitic word.

Some examples of the use of Auwag in negating imperatives, hortatives, and optatives are:

Affirmative Negative

Basahin mo iyang liham. > Huwag mong basahin iyang liham.
‘Read that letter.” ‘Don’t read that letter.”

Magsayaw kayo ng pandanggo. > Huwag kayong magsayaw ng pandanggo.
“Dance a fandango.” “Don’t dance a fandango.”

Umalis tayo. > Huwag tayong umalis.

‘Let’s leave.” ‘Let’s not leave.’

Tawagin ko kaya ang duktor. > Huwag ko kayang tawagin ang duktor.
‘Perhaps I should call the doctor.” “Perhaps I shouldn’t call the doctor.”

The enclitic particles nga and naman frequently occur with huwag in negative imperatives and
hortatives; the enclitic particle sana frequently occurs with huwag in negative optatives. The function of nga
in the negative constructions differs from its function in the corresponding affirmative constructions. In the

affirmative constructions nga is equivalent to ‘please,’ but with Auwag it serves to intensify the negation.
Thus:

Magsayaw nga kayo ng pandanggo.
‘Please dance a fangango.’

Elements sous droits d'auteur
524 CHAPTER 7

but:

Huwag nga kayong magsayaw ng pandanggo.
‘Don’t (by any means) dance a fandango.’

Naman is equivalent to ‘please’ (plus an implication of mild reproach or complaint) in negative, as in
affirmative, imperatives and hortatives. Thus:

Umalis naman tayo. > Huwag naman tayong umalis.
‘Let’s Icave, please. ‘Let’s not leave, please.
(We've stayed long enough.)’ (Why do you suggest that we leave?)’

As was noted in §5.30, sana adds the meaning ‘I hope’ to an affirmative optative construction. It is
used in the same way in negative optatives:

Pumarito sana siya. > Huwag sana siyang pumarito.
‘I hope he comes here.” ‘I hope he doesn’t come here.”

As in the case of affirmative optatives, the actor may be expressed by a noun or nominalization, as well as a
pronoun, if sana is present;

Pumarito sana si Juan. > Huwag sanang pumarito si Juan.
‘I hope Juan comes here.’ ‘Lhope Juan doesn’t come here.’

In the case of negative optatives, however, the presence of sana (or one of certain other enclitics — cf.
§5.30) with a noun or nominalization as actor is not strictly obligatory, as it is in the case of affirmative
hortatives. Thus, while there is no *Pumarito si Juan, a sentence like Huwag pumarito si Juan ‘I don’t want

Juan to come here’ is acceptable to many speakers.
In addition to its occurrence in negative imperatives, hortatives and optatives, /uwag may be used to
add the meaning of negative desire to virtually any statement, including those in which another negative is

already present, ¢.g.:

Huwag kang walang pera.
‘Don’t be without money.’

Huwag tayong hindi mabait.
‘Let’s not be unkind.’

When huwag precedes a statement that includes a verbal predicate or a nominalized verbal topic (cf.
§3.24) in the perfective aspect, the enclitic particle sana must be used. Thus:

Huwag sanang nagdala ng bigas si Juan.
‘[ hope Juan didn’t bring any rice.”

Huwag sanang siya ang nakatanggap ng sulat.
‘Lhope he isn’t the one who got the letter.’

but not:

*Huwag nagdala ng bigas si Juan, etc.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 525

In all other cases the use of sana is optional. However, either sana or nga is normal after huwag in
narrationa) sentences that have a non-pronoun actor or in equational sentences that have a non-pronoun
topic. Thus, normally:

Huwag sanang ginagamit ni Pedro ang kotse.
‘Lhope Pedro isn’t using the car.’

Huwag ngang walang pera si Ben.
‘I don’t want Ben to be without money.’

But sentences like Huwag ginagamit ni Pedro ang kotse and Huwag walang pera si Ben are acceptable to
many speakers.

Two further uses of huwag remain to be mentioned. The word occurs in short sentences, cither alone
or in combination with one or more enclitic particles, to express the meaning ‘Don’t do that,’ ‘I don’t want
that to happen,’ etc. (In such short sentences no linker occurs: ¢.g., /uwag (muna) *Don’t do that (yet).’)
Huwag also occurs in the sequence huwag (na) (hindi, a double negative, which is used to intensify an

affirmative imperative: e.g.,

Huwag na hindi ka magpahinga.
“Be sure to rest.’

The na in this construction is an optional linker. The hindi in the construction may be contracted to
di — cf. §7.13. Huwag (na) (hindi also occurs as a subordinating conjunction, meaning ‘however little,’ in
concessive adverbial clauses. This use of the sequence is dealt with in §6.17, subsection (2).

§7.16. Negation with ayaw, aywan, dili, and ni.

Each of the four remaining negators—ayaw, aywan, dili and ni—has a relatively restricted
distribution and range of meanings. Ayaw, the negative counterpart of the pseudo—verbs gusto, ibig, and
nais, has the meaning ‘doesn’t/don’t want/like.’ The various constructions in which ayaw occurs are dealt
with in detail in §4.21. While ayaw is the usual negative of gusto, ibig, and nais, these affirmative
pseudo—verbs may also be negated by Aindi. Hindi plus an affirmative pseudo—verb is not always freely
substitutable for ayaw, however, since the hindi constructions occur in exactly the same contexts as the
affirmative pscudo—verbs themselves, while ayaw and the affirmative pseudo—verbs have somewhat
different distributions.

Aywan may be literally translated as ‘not known.’ It alternates with hindi alam ‘not known’ (cf.

§3.28, subsection (3)) when the following conditions are met:
(1) the actor is expressed by a first—person or dual ng pronoun (Ko, namin, nita, natin) unless the

sentence includes the enclitic daw/raw ‘it is said,’ (in which case any ng-phrase actor may occur) or unless
no actor is expressed (in which case the actor ko ‘I’ is understood):

(2) what is not known is either expressed by a Kung clause or unexpressed.
Examples of alternation between aywan and hindi alam are:

Hindi namin alam

kung saan siya pumunta.
Aywan namin

“We don’t know where he went.’

Hindi raw alam
ng bata kung nasaan ang nanay niya.

Aywan daw
‘The child says he doesn’t know where his mother is.’

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
526 CHAPTER 7

(The above sentence with hindi raw alam is ambiguous. It can mean either “The child says he doesn’t
know...” or ‘Somebody says the child doesn’t know...’ The sentence with aywan daw, on the other

hand, means only ‘The child says... ”)

Hindi ko alam.
Sino ba siya?

Aywan (ko).
“Who is he?’ ‘t don’t know.”

Examples of contexts in which hindi alam occurs, but aywan docs not, are:

Hindi ko alam iyon.
‘t don’t know that.’

Hindi namin alam na umuwi na siya.
‘We didn’t know that he had already gone home.’

Hindi alam ng bata kung nasaan ang nanay niya.
‘The child doesn’t know where his mother is.’

Dili occurs in constructions of three types: in confirmation questions, followed by (nga) ba’t (cf.
§7.6); in o dili kaya, a literary variant of o kaya ‘or else’ (cf. §7.19, subsection (2)); and after the basic
form of an actor—focus verb, the construction expressing the meaning of ‘hardly,’ or ‘rarely’ performing the

action of the verb. An example of the use of dili in a confirmation question is:

Dili nga ba’t titser siya?
‘Isn’t it obvious he’s a teacher?”

An example of o dili kaya is:

Paparito kami sa Linggo, o dili kaya sa Lunes.
‘We shall come on Sunday, or else on Monday.”

Some examples of the use of dili after the basic form of an actor—focus verb are:

Magsalita-dili ang bata.
‘The child hardly speaks.”

Pumasok-dili siya sa iskwela.
‘He rarely attends school.’

Kumain-dili ka ng pagkain mo.
‘You hardly touch your food.”

Ni occurs only in sentences that include some other negator as well. It has two uses. Preceding each
element of a coordinate construction (cf. §7.19), ni... ni, in combination with the other negator in the

sentence, expresses the equivalent of English ‘neither... nor,’ ‘not... cither... or.” Some examples are:

Hindi dumating ni si Juan ni si Pedro.
‘Neither Juan nor Pedro came.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 527

Walang kasangkapan ni rito ni roon.
‘There isn’t any furniture either here or there.”

Ayaw nilang magtrabaho ni ngayon ni bukas.
‘They don’t want to work either today or tomorrow.’

In other than coordinate constructions, ni together with the other negator in the sentence expresses
the meaning ‘not even’: e.g.,

Hindi siya nagdala ni lapis.
‘He did not bring even a pencil.’

(cf. Hindi siya nagdala ng lapis.
‘He did not bring a pencil.’)

As the last example shows, ni replaces the ng of a ng phrase serving as object complement. Further
examples of the replacement are:

ni kape ni tsa,
Ayaw niyang uminom

ni kape.
to drink either tea or coffee.”
‘He doesn’t want

even coffee.’

(cf. Ayaw niyang uminom ng kape.
‘He doesn’t want to drink coffee.”)

Ni also replaces the linker -ng after wala, thus:

ni pontimpen ni lapis)
Wala siya
ni pontimpen.
has neither a fountain pen nor a =
“He
doesn’t even have a fountain pen.”

(cf. Wala siyang pontimpen.
‘He doesn’t have a fountain pen.’)

Where the nominal that would occur in an object complement or after wala is the ng form of a deictic
pronoun, the corresponding ang form of the pronoun is used after ni, thus:

ne bumab:

asa)
ni ito ni iyon si Jose.
Wala

reads
“Jose neither this nor that.”
has

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
528 CHAPTER 7

Hindi bumabasa
(cf. nito si Jose.
Wala
tead
‘Jose doesn’t this.”)
have

A phrase introduced by ni or a coordinate construction with ni... ni normally occurs in
sentence—initial or clause—initial position, in a construction that shows ay inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection
(1)). Thus, in preference to the last example:

hindi bumabasa
Ni ito ni iyon ay si Jose.
wala

Inversion is normally obligatory in the case of the following:

(a) topics introduced by ni (but not coordinate topics introduced by ni... ni): e.g.,

Ni si Juan ay hindi nakapunta doon.’
‘Not even Juan was able to go there.’

but not, for most speakers:

*Hindi nakapunta doon ni si Juan.

(b) object complements of the shape ni plus deictic pronoun: ¢.g.,

Ni ito ay hindi sila nagtitinda.
‘They don’t sell even this.’

but not:

*Eindi sila nagtitinda ni ito.
(cf. Hindi sila nagtitinda nito.
‘They don’t sell this.’)

(c) actor complements introduced by ni, or coordinate actor complements introduced by ni... ni. If

the nominal in an actor complement introduced by ni (or ni... ni) is a marked noun (cf. §3.2), an ang
form is used: e.g.,

siya
Ni si Juan ay hindi magagawa ang trabaho.
ito ni iyon
he
‘Not even can do the work.”
Juan.
‘Neither this one nor that one

(cf. Hindi ang trabaho.

‘He
‘Juan can’t do the work.’)
‘This one and that one

If the nominal in the actor complement is an unmarked noun (cf. §3.6), ni is followed by ang if a meaning
of definiteness is intended; otherwise no marker is used: e.g.,

ang karpintero ay
Ni hindi magagawa ang trabaho.
karpintero ay
the
‘Not even carpenter can do the work.”
a

(cf. Hindi magagawa ng karpintero ang trabaho.

‘The
carpenter can’t do the work.’)
‘A

§7.17. The definitized predicate.

An unmarked noun occurring in predicate position is given a meaning of definiteness if it is preceded
by the marker ang. (Without the preceding marker, an unmarked noun in predicate position normally
expresses either an indefinite or a generic meaning — cf. §3.6.) The English equivalent of a definitized
unmarked—noun predicate is normally ‘the’ plus the translation equivalent of the noun.

Definitized predicates often occur in answers to information questions introduced by siro ‘who’ (cf.

§7.9), ang ano ‘what (particular thing),” or (ang) alin ‘which’ (cf. §7.8): e.g.,

Sino ang titser? > Ang Amerikana ang titser.

‘The American is the teacher.’
“Who’s the teacher?”

‘The teacher is the American.’
Ang ano ang nasunog? > Ang kame ang nasunog.

‘The meat got burned.”
“What got bumed?’

‘What got burned is the meat.’
(Ang) alin ang pinakamahal? > Ang singsing ang pinakamahal.

‘The ring is the most expensive.”
‘Which is the most expensive?’ ate Pe

‘The most expensive is the ring.”

Elements sous droits d'auteur
530 CHAPTER 7

As these examples show, definitized predicates, like other predicates, express relatively new information.
But while Tagalog consistently expresses the new information in the predicate, English, in the case of
sentences equivalent to Tagalog sentences with definitized predicates, may express the new information in
either the subject or the predicate, indicating by intonation which item represents the new information.
(Hereafter, Tagalog sentences with definitized predicates are translated by English sentences in which the
subject expresses the new information. This represents the more common English translation equivalent.)

A nominalized adjectival or verbal may occur instead of an unmarked noun in definitized—predicate
position, as in most other positions (cf. §3.24). Some examples are:

Ang maganda ang dumating kahapon.
‘The pretty one is the one that came yesterday.”

Ang naroon ang para sa iyo.
‘The one over there is the one for you.”

Ang mga nagtatrabaho sa pabrika ang kumikita ng maraming pera.
‘The ones who work in the factory are the ones who make lots of money.”

Ang binili ko sa Maynila ang pinakamabuti.
‘The one I bought in Manila is the best.’

Definitized predicates are more restricted than indefinite predicates with regard to the types of topics
opposite which they occur. Specifically, a definitized unmarked—noun predicate may occur opposite
another unmarked noun or a nominalization, but not, normally, opposite a marked noun. Thus:

titser.
Ang Amerikana ang mayaman.
nakita ko.

teacher.”
‘The American is the rich one.”
one I saw.”
but not:
si Helen.
*Ang Amerikana siya.
iyon.

And a definitized adjectival or verbal predicate may occur opposite a nominalized topic but not, normally,
Opposite a nominal topic. Thus:

naroon gusto ko.
Ang ang
nakita ko dumating kahapon

over there Tlike.’
‘The one is the one
I saw that came yesterday.’

but not:

*Ang siya.
nakita ko iyon.

§7.18. Indefinite expressions and constructions.

INDEFINITE EXPRESSIONS are usually equivalent to English expressions that involve ‘any,’ ‘no,’ or
‘ever.’ The English equivalent varies with the construction in which the indefinite expression occurs. Note,
for example, the translations of the indefinite expression kahit na saan in the following sentences:

Pumupunta sila kahit na saan.
‘They go anywhere.”

Hindi sila pumupunta kahit na saan.

go nowhere.”
‘They

don’t go anywhere

Kahit na saan sila pumunta, hinahangaan sila.
“Wherever

they go, they are admired.’
“Anywhere

The indefinite expressions to be discussed in the present section are those that include an
interrogative word (cf. §7.7). (For a discussion of indefinite may phrases, cf. §4.23.) Any interrogative
word other than bakit ‘why’ and kumusta ‘how (quality)’ may occur in an indefinite expression of this
type. The occurring interrogative words are thus: alin, ano, Kanino, gaano, ilan, magkano, nakanino, nasaan
(= saan naroon — cf. §7.10), nino, paano, saan, sino. (The English equivalents of the interrogative words
are given in §7.7. For English equivalents of indefinite expressions in which the words occur, see the
examples below.)

The structure of an indefinite expression may be any of the following:

(1) kahit (na) + interrogative word

(2)  interrogative word + man

(3) kahit (na) + interrogative word + man
That is, the interrogative word may be: (1) preceded by Kahir plus, optionally, the a form of the linker
naj-ng (cf. §3.8); (2) followed by the enclitic particle man (cf. §6.4, subsection (a)); (3) both preceded by
kahit (na) and followed by man. In the case of any given interrogative word, the indefinite expressions with
these three structures are more or less identical in meaning and grammatical function. (The structure that
includes both kahit (na) and man is less common than cither of the other structures.)

(Apart from its use in indefinite expressions, kahit (na) also occurs in the meaning ‘even’: e.g.,

Kahit (na) si Ben ay magagawa iyon.
‘Even Ben can do that.’

Kahit (na) lumang diyaryo ay binibili nita.
‘They even buy old newspapers.”)

CN ee eee eee eee cceea ac ese ass sss sss ees ee ee ese ee se eS
532 CHAPTER 7

When an indefinite construction that includes man occurs at the beginning of a sentence or clause,
man functions as a normal enclitic particle, and its position in relation to other enclitic words (particles and
pronouns) is as specified in §6.2: e.g.,

Saan ka man pumunta....
“Wherever you go...”

Saan man sila pumunta ....
“Wherever they go...”

When, however, the indefinite expression is not sentence— or clause—initial, man always immediately
follows the interrogative word: e.g.,

Hindi ka pumupunta saan man.
“You don’t go anywhere.”

If no other enclitic comes between the interrogative word and man, the two elements may usually be
written as either one or two words. Thus, also:

Saanman sila pumunta....
Hindi ka pumupunta saanman.

(The two—word writing is preferred in the case of expressions with gaano, magkano, and paano, the
one—word writing in other cases.)

In the case of interrogative words written with a word—final o, this o is retained if man is written as a
separate word, but changed to u if it is not. Thus:

ano man
ano + man +

anuman

sino man
sino + man >

sinuman

The constructions in which indefinite expressions occur are discussed below under the following
headings: (1) INDEFINITE NOMINAL PHRASES; (2) INDEFINITE ADVERBIAL PHRASES;
(3) INDEFINITE NOMINAL CLAUSES; (4) INDEFINITE ADVERBIAL CLAUSES.

(1) INDEFINITE NOMINAL PHRASES. An indefinite nominal phrase is a phrase that consists of or
includes an indefinite expression, and that occurs in a sentence position and function typical of a nominal.
Indefinite nominal phrases thus occur as sentence topics, verb complements, possessive modifiers, etc. The
topic marker ang is optionally deletable before an indefinite-nominal—phrase topic that includes Kahit,
when the topic occurs in normal non-inverted position:

alin(man).

ano.
anuman.

Gamitin mo (ang) kahit (na) gaano (man).
ilan(man).
magkano (man).

DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 533

any quantity.’
“Use

any amount (of money).’
anyone.”

Ang is always retained before a non-inverted topic that does not include kahit. Thus:

nan

Gamitin mo ang 2 anuman.
etc.

Before an inverted indefinite—nominal—phrase topic (in ay inversion or contrastic inverson — cf.
§7.2) ang is obligatorily deleted if the indefinite expression is not part of a modification construction;

otherwise, the marker is optional. Thus:

Kahit (na) alin(man)
ay gamitin mo.
Alinman
“Use any.’
ano,
Kahit (na)
anuman, gamitin mo.
Anuman,
“Use anything.’
sinong
(Ang) kahit (na) piyanista ay makakatugtog ng ganyang piyesa.
sinumang

“Any pianist can play a piece like that.’

The marker ng is optionally deletable before an indefinite nominal phrase that includes kahit when
the phrase is used as an object complement and occurs in normal non-inverted position: e.g.,

Magdala ka (ng) kahit (na) ilan(man).
‘Bring any number.’

Once more, the marker is retained if the phrase does not include kahit:
Magdala ka ng ilanman.
(See below for a discussion of inverted indefinite—nominal—phrase complements.)

The marker ng is not deletable before an indefinite nominal phrase serving as an actor complement in
normal non-inverted position, or serving as a possessive modifier:

sat "

Ninuman is in itself a ng-phrase equivalent, and is not preceded by a marker. It alternates freely with

Hindi siya ginigising (sinuman.

saanman.
‘Don’t go anywhere.’
kanino.
kahit (na)
Huwag mong ibigay ito (sa) kaninuman.
kaninuman.

‘Don’t give this to anyone.”

(Indefinite expressions formed with saan and Kanino are in themselves sa-phrase equivalents. Saan is never
preceded by the marker sa. In indefinite expressions involving kanino, sa is optional.)

A modification construction with an indefinite expression serving as its initial component may occur
in any of the constructions in which indefinite expressions themselves occur. (As in other cases, the
components of the modification construction are linked by the linker na/-ng — cf. §3.11.) In modification
constructions, indefinite expressions of the shape interrogative-word—plus—man are more common that
those that include kahit. Some examples of modification constructions serving as indefinite nominal phrases
are:

anong
{ (ang) kahit (na)

anumang

Gamitin mo pinggan.

lane anumang
“Use any dish.”

Magdala ka ng ilanmang baro.
“Bring any number of dresses.”

Huwag mong ibigay ito (sa) kaninumang bata.
‘Don't give this to any child,’

A verb or verbal construction may serve as the final component of a modification construction that

begins with an indefinite expression. The basic form of the verb (cf. §2.8) may occur in such a
construction, in alternation with cither the contemplated—aspect or the imperfective—aspect form; the

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 535

basic form is preferred to the inflected forms. Some examples of constructions of this type serving nominal
functions are:

anong.
(ang) kahit (na) | mangyayari.
anuman

ang anumang

‘They will tell you anything that happens.’

nagdaraan.
Pinapahinto nila ang sinumang
magdaan.

“They stop anyone who passes by.”

(The basic form magdaan is preferred to the imprefective—aspect form nagdaraan.)

Kumuha sila ng anumang inihandog ng mga iba.
‘They took anything the others offered.’

Indefinite—nominal—phrase verb complements other than ninuman may occur sentence—initially in
ay inversion or in contrastive inversion (cf. §7.2, subsection (1.c)). Where the inverted indefinite nominal
phrase is an object complement, it must include kahit; where it is an actor or directional complement, it
may or may not include kahit. The marker ng is obligatorily deleted before an inverted actor or object
complement. Examples are:

ano

(but not:

(2) INDEFINITE ADVERBIAL PHRASES. An indefinite adverbial phrase is a phrase that consists of
or includes an indefinite expression and that occurs in a sentence position and function typical of a
movable adverb (cf. §§6.7 through 6.11). Indefinite adverbial phrases of time commonly include kailan,
those of place saan, and those of manner paano. Some examples are:

kahit (na) kailan(man).
Matatapos namin ito
kailanman.
‘We can finish this at any time.”

kahit (na) kailan(man)
Hindi sinabi ni Pedro iyon.
kailanman

‘Pedro never said that.’
a na saan(man)

Saanman
‘They’re not happy anywhere.’

ay hindi sila masasaya.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
‘DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 537

kahit (na) paano (man).
Maililipat namin ang bahay

paano man.
‘We'll be able to move the house somehow.’

(In cases like the above, where the indefinite expression constitutes the entire adverbial phrase, the kahit

constructions are more common than those without kahit.) Certain other interrogative words may also
occur within indefinite adverbial phrases: e.g.,
ano.
kahit (na)
anuman.

anuman,

Huwag kang magtanong tungkol sa
‘Don’t ask about anything.’

kanino.
kahit (na)

kaninuman.
Hindi ko gagawin iyon para
kaninuman.
‘I won't do that for anyone.’

Some examples of modification constructions serving as indefinite adverbial phrases are:

ilang
frat (na)
ilanmang

loanmeng
‘We will visit them any number of times.’

Dadalawin namin sila nang ulit.

Nagagawa iyon saanmang siyudad.
‘That can be donc in any city.”

Sa halip ng anumang suweldo, binigyan siya ng bahay.
‘Instead of any wages, he was given a house.”

(3) INDEFINITE NOMINAL CLAUSES. Like indefinite nominal phrases (cf. (1), above), indefinite
nominal clauses occupy typically nominal sentence positions. The clauses are distinguished from the phrases
by the fact that they include within themselves a predicate and a topic. The predicate of an indefinite
clause is an indefinite expression or a modification construction introduced by an indefinite expression. An
indefinite nominal clause thus resembles an information question to which kahit (na) and/or man has been
added. Compare, for example:

ano
kahit (na)
anuman

Ibibigay ko sa iyo ang gusto mo.
anuman
‘PU give you whatever you want.”

Elements sous droits d'auteur
538 CHAPTER 7

and:
Ano ang gusto mo?
“What do you want?’
Or:
kahit (na) alin(man)g
Ibibigay ko sa iyo larawan ang gusto mo.
alinmang
‘TIl give you whichever picture you want.’
and:

Aling larawan ang gusto mo?
‘Which picture do you want?”

As the above examples illustrate, the topic marker ang is not used before an indefinite nominal clause
occurring as a sentence topic. This is also true when the topic is inverted:

Kahit (na) ano ang gusto mo, ibibigay ko sa iyo.
‘Whatever you want, Ill give (it) to you.”

Indefinite nominal clauses that include kahit may serve as object complements in either non-inverted
or inverted position. The clauses are not preceded by a marker. Thus:

ano

anuman
‘Til give you whatever you want.”

Bibigyan kita kahit (na) ang gusto mo.

ano

Kahit (na) ang gusto mo, bibigyan kita.
anuman

‘Whatever you want, I'll give (it) to you.’

Indefinite clauses that do not include kahit occur as object complements only in non-inverted position. The
marker ng always precedes such a clause. Thus:

Bibigyan kita ng anuman ang gusto mo.

Indefinite nominal clauses serving as directional complements may occur in either non-inverted or
inverted position. The clauses are not preceded by a marker. Thus:

saanman
“He gocs wherever I go.”

Kahit (na) saan(man) "f rn

kahit (na) saan(man) pumupunta.
Pumupunta siya ako

pumunta.

Saanman ako
“Wherever I go, he goes.’

pumupunta siya.
pumunta,

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 539

(See below for a discussion of alternation between inflected and basic forms of verbs — e.g., pumupunta ~
pumunta — in indefinite clauses.)
Indefinite nominal clauses serving as actor complements occur only in inverted position. No marker is

used. Thus:
sino
Kahit (na)
sinuman

Sinuman
“Whoever is here will see that.’

ang narito, makikita iyan.

If the predicate of an indefinite clause is a verbal, or if the topic is a nominalized verbal, the basic
form of the verb may be used. As in the case of modification constructions that include indefinite
expressions and verbs, (cf. (1), above), the basic verb form alternates with, and is preferred to, either the
contemplated—aspect or the imperfective—aspect form. (The preference for the basic form is particularly
strong when the indefinite expression is formed with man.) Some examples of indefinite nominal clauses

with nominalized verbal topics are:

kahit (na) magkano (man) hihingin
Babayaran nila ang mo.
magkano man hingin
‘They will pay whatever amount you ask.”

(Hingin is preferred to hihingin.)

{ kahit (na) {i ant

‘I'm told about whoever calls on them.’
(Dumalaw is preferred to dumadalaw.)

Kahit (na) alin(man)

ang pinili niya, pipiliin ko rin.
Alinman

‘Whichever he chose, I'll choose (it) too.”

(4) INDEFINITE ADVERBIAL CLAUSES. Indefinite adverbial clauses resemble indefinite nominal
clauses in structure, but are optionally introduced by the particle kung. Like other adverbial clauses (cf.
§6.14), an indefinite adverbial clause may either precede or follow the main clause. Some examples are:

kahit (na) kailan(man)
Naglilibang kami (kung) siya dumating.

kailanman
“We have a good time whenever he comes.’

{ nasaan(man) \
kahit (na) saan(man) naroon

§7.19. Coordination.

As was explained in §3.10, coordination is a grammatical device for combining elements of two (or
more) underlying sentences into a single resultant sentence. The resultant sentence contains a coordinate
construction, consisting of two (or more) coordinates linked by a coordinating conjunction. Certain
coordinate constructions, in which the coordinates are nominals, and in which the coordinating conjunction
is at ‘and,’ are presented separately in §3.10. (A special coordinate construction consisting of a plural
personal pronoun plus a ng phrase — e.g., Kayo ng Nanay ‘you and Mother’ — is also presented in §3.10.)
The present section is concerned with coordinate constructions of other types.

In addition to nominals, elements of a number of other kinds — among them, adjectivals, verbals,
adverbials, and clauses — may serve as coordinates. The italicized portions of the following sentences are all
coordinate constructions:

Maganda at mayaman si Rosa.
‘Rosa is beautiful and rich.’

Kakanta at saka sasayaw si Rosa.
‘Rosa will sing and then dance.”

Noong Sabado o noong Linggo namin nakita si Rosa.
‘It was last Saturday or last Sunday that we saw Rosa.’

Matalino si Rosa pero hindi mabuti ang mga marka niya.
‘Rosa is intelligent but her grades aren’t good.”

A sentence with two coordinate clauses has a certain similarity to a sentence consisting of a main
clause followed by an adverbial clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction (cf. §6.14), such as:

Matalino si Rosa bagama’t hindi mabuti ang mga marka niya.
‘Rosa is intelligent although her grades aren’t good.’

But while a clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction may alternatively precede the main clause, a
clause introduced by a coordinating conjunction cannot precede the clause with which it is coordinate.
Thus:

Bagama’t hindi mabuti ang mga marka niya, matalino si Rosa.
‘Although her grades aren’t good, Rosa is intelligent.

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES S41

but not:

*Pero hindi mabuti ang mga marka niya, matalino si Rosa.

The major Tagalog coordinating conjunctions are presented below as follows: (1) at, at saka, and at
nang; (2) 0, o kaya, and o dili kaya; (3) kung kaya’t; (4) ni... ni;(5) kundi; (6) pero, datapwa't, nguni’t,
and subali’t; (7) nang (hin}dl, naj-ng + (hin li, nang wala, and na/-ng + wala.

(1) At /’at/ is equivalent to English ‘and.’ When the word that precedes it ends, in its independent
form, in /’/, /h/, or /n/, and when there is no intervening pause, af is optionally but commonly contracted
to ’t /t/; the contracted form replaces the final /’/, /hf, or /n/. For example:

masama /masama’/ + ’t > masama’t /masamat/
“bad” ‘bad and’

maganda /magandah/ + °t > maganda’t /magandat/
‘beautiful’ ‘beautiful and’
mayaman /maya‘man/ + ’t > mayama’t /maya’mat/
‘rich’ ‘tich and”

Examples of the use of af in coordinate nominal constructions are presented in §3.10. Some
examples of its use in coordinate constructions of other types are:

Huhugasa’t pupunasan namin ang mga pinggan.
“We'll wash and dry the dishes.”

Huhugasan ko ang mga pinggan, at pupunasan mo.
‘V’ll wash the dishes, and you'll dry them.’

Huhugasan ko ang mga pinggan ngayon at bukas.
“Fl wash the dishes today and tomorrow.”

At may be used to coordinate more than two words, phrases, or clauses: e.g.,

Kumanta’t sumayaw at tumawa’t naglaro ang mga bata.
‘The children sang and danced and laughed and played.”

As in English, all but the last of the coordinating conjunctions may optionally be replaced by a pause. Thus,
also:

Kumanta, sumayaw, tumawa’t naglaro ang mga bata.
‘The children sang, danced, laughed, and played.’

(For a discussion of the use of a¢ in explanatary clauses, cf. §7.20.)

At saka usually means ‘and then’ when it occurs between coordinate verbals or between clauses with
verbal predicates:

Naligo at saka nagbihis si Juan.
‘Juan took a bath and then dressed.’

Dumating ang prinsipal at saka nag-umpisa ang palatuntunan.
‘The principal arrived and then the program began.”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
542 CHAPTER 7

°

In most other contexts, at saka means ‘and (also)’ or ‘and . . . too”:

Magdadala ako ng tinapay at saka ng matamis.
‘Tl bring some bread and (also) some sweets.’

Maganda ang bata at saka malusog.
‘The child is beautiful and healthy too.’

A clause introduced by at saka plus the enclitic particle pa may follow a clause that is introduced by
kung kailan and that includes the enclitic particle na. In such a sentence, the initial clause is equivalent to
an English clause introduced by ‘now when,’ and the af saka clause expresses an action or situation
considered inappropriate because of the action or situation expressed in the initial clause. Examples are:

Kung kailan lumajakad na ang bus, at saka pa hihingi ng inumin ang bata.
‘Now when the bus is moving, the child asks for a drink.’

Kung kailan dumarating na ang mga bisita, at saka ka pa maglilinis ng bahay.
“Now when the guests are arriving, you clean the house.’

Note that, in this construction, a contemplated—aspect verb in the at saka clause expresses present action.

At nang means ‘so that’ or ‘in order that.’ It always connects clauses, and the clause that follows it
always has a verbal predicate. When the predicate verb after at nang is an imperfective or perfective form,
the initial clause normally includes the enclitic particle sana (cf. §6.5, subsection (e)), and the sentence
expresses an action that should have occurred but did not occur, and the hypothetical result of this action.

(palaging) nakakagalitan.
Naging mabait ka sana at nang hindi ka niya

nakagalitan.

(always) get

‘You should have been good so that he would not angry with you.”

have gotten

At nang is never followed by a clause with a contemplated—aspect verbal predicate. [t may, however,
be followed by a clause with the basic form of a verb (cf. §2.8) in predicate position. The meaning of such

a clause is similar to that of an adverbial clause of purpose introduced by para or upang (cf. §6.16,
subsection (c)). An example is:

Matulog tayo nang maaga at nang makaalis tayo nang maaga bukas.
“Let’s go to sleep early so that we can leave early tomorrow.’

(2) Os equivalent to English ‘or’:

Kumuha ka ng lapis 0 (ng) pontimpen.
‘Get a pencil or a fountain pen.’

Tbibigay ko ito sa Nanay o kay Maria.
‘Tl! give this to Mother or to Maria.”

(Coordinate nominal constructions with o follow the same rules as coordinate nominal construction with at
concerning the deletion or retention of markers before non-initial coordinates — cf. §3.10.)

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 543

Like at (cf. (1), above), o may be used to coordinate more than two words, phrases, or clauses, with
all but the last of the coordinating conjunctions being optionally replaced by pause:

Lunes 0
Darating ang inspektor sa (sa) Martes 0 (sa) Miyerkoles.
Lunes,

Monday or
‘The inspector will come on (on) Tuesday or (on) Wednesday.”

Monday,

(For a discussion of the use of o in alternative questions, cf. §7.5.)

The equivalent of English ‘either . . . or’ is expressed by a coordinate construction involving o and the
enclitle particle man (cf. §6.4, subsection (a.6), which occurs as part of the first coordinate. The coordinate
that includes man must be sentence initial, and consequently the sentence often involves inversion (cf.
§7.2). Examples are:

Ikaw man o ako ay maaaring gumawa niyan.
‘Either you or J can do that.’

Sa loob man o sa labas ay maari tayong magsayawan.
‘We can hold the dance cither indoors or outdoors.”

O kaya means ‘or else.” It always constitutes a separate intonation phrase. Examples are:

Kumuha ka ng lapis, o kaya, (ng) pontimpen.
‘Get a pencil, or else a fountain pen.’

Magmiting tayo bukas, o kaya, sa Linggo.
‘Let’s hold a meeting tomorrow, or else on Sunday.’

Odili kaya isa literary variant of o kaya.
(3) Kung kaya’t is equivalent to English ‘so’ or ‘therefore.’ It is used to coordinate clauses. Examples

are:

Marami akong gagawin, kung kaya’t hindi ako makadadalo sa pulong.
‘I’ve got a lot to do, so I won’t be able to attend the meeting.’

Umuulan, kung kaya’t pumasok kami sa sine.
‘It was raining, so we went to the movies.’

(4) The uses of ni... ni, which, together with a negator, is equivalent to English ‘neither . . . nor,
not... cither ... or,’ are discussedin §7.16. Some further examples are:

Ni ngayon ni bukas ay hindi ako makakaalis.
‘I won’t be able to Icave either today or tomorrow.”

Wala siya ni magulang ni kapatid.
‘He has neither parents nor brothers and sisters.”

 
544 CHAPTER 7

(5) Kundi is equivalent to English ‘but’ in the sense ‘but rather’ or ‘except (for).’ It occurs only in
sentences that involve a negator, usually hindi or wala (cf. § §7.13, 7.14). Some examples of its use are:

Hindi dito kundi sa bayan ang pulong.
‘The meeting’s not here but (rather) in town.”

Hindi si Juan ang darating kundi si Pedro.
‘It’s not Juan who's coming but (rather) Pedro.’

Walang tao doon kundi si Ben.
‘There’s no one there but/except (for) Ben.”

Wala siyang pera kundi sasumpung sentimo.
‘He has no money but/except (for) ten cents.”

(6) When ‘but’ does not have the meaning ‘but rather’ or ‘except (for),” its most common Tagalog
counterpart is pero. In formal contexts, pero is often replaced by datapwa’t, nguni't, or subali’t. Examples
are:

Hindi namin magagawa ngayon, pero gagawin namin bukas.
‘We can’t do it today, but we'll do it tomorrow.”

Gusto kong pumunta sa parti, pero siya, ayaw.
‘I want to go to the party, but he doesn’t.”

datapwa’t

Hinanap niya ang kuwintas nguni’t hindi na niya nakitang muli.
subali’t

‘She searched for the necklace but she never saw it again.’

(7) Nang or the linker naj-ng (cf. §3.8) plus one of the negators hindi, di, or wala (cf. § §7.13 and
7.14) are equivalent to certain uses of ‘without’ in English. They are used to coordinate clauses.

Clauses introduced by nang or naj-ng plus (hindi always have imperfective—aspect or
perfective—aspect verbal predicates. If the predicate verb is in the imperfective aspect, the English
equivalent has ‘without’ plus the ‘-ing’ form of a verb; if the verb is in the perfective aspect, the English
equivalent has ‘without’ plus ‘having’ plus a past participle. Examples are:

nang

Nakakapagbisikleta si Manuel (hin)di humahawak sa manibela.
na

‘Manuel can ride a bicycle without holding on to the handlebars.’

siya nang

Umalis hindi niya nakita ang prinsipal.
siyang

‘He left without having seen the principal.’

The sentences underlying clauses introduced by nang or na/-ng plus wala may be possessive,
existential, or indefinite. Examples are:

nang
Paano siya makakapaglakbay wala siyang pera?

na
‘How will he be able to travel without having any money?”

Eléments sous droits d'auteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 345

(cf. Wala siyang pera.
“He doesn’t have any money.’)

sila nang

Naupo walang pagkain sa mesa.
silang

‘They sat down without there being any food on the table.’

(cf. Walang pagkain sa mesa.
‘There is no food on the table.)

siya nang

Lumaki walang nalalamang trabaho.
siyang

‘He grew up without knowing any trade.”

(cf. Wala siyang nalalamang trabaho.
‘He doesn’t know any trade.’)

(A clause introduced by nang hindi or nang wala is sometimes ambiguous, since mang may also
introduce a time clause (cf. §6.14, subsection (5.c)), and the predicate of this clause may be negated by
hindi or wala. Thus the sentence:

Umalis siya nang hindi niya nakita ang prinsipal.

may mean ‘He left when he didn’t see the principal,” as well as ‘He left without having seen the principal.’
In other cases, however, there is no ambiguity, since a nang time clause always refers to a situation or action
confined to the past, while a nang (hin Jdi/wala clause equivalent to an English ‘without’ construction is not
similarly restricted. A nang time clause, furthermore, like other adverbial clauses, may occur
sentence—initially, while a coordinate clause introduced by nang (hin jdi/wala is never sentence—initial.)

§7.20. Explanatory at clauses.

The use of af as a coordinating conjunction, equivalent to English ‘and,’ is discussed in §3.10, and in
§7.19, subsection (1). The present section is concerned with the use of at in clauses equivalent to certain
English clauses optionally introduced by ‘that’: ¢.g., the underlined English clauses in:

Mabuti at pupunta ka.
‘It’s good (that) you're going.”

Salamat at hindi ako nahuhuli.
‘Thank goodness (that) I’m not late.”

Nagagalak ako at narito sila.
‘I’m glad (that) they’re here.’

While the English clauses that translate these av clauses serve several different grammatical functions, the at
clauses themselves may conveniently be grouped together into a single class of EXPLANATORY
CLAUSES, having in common the function of explaining the circumstances that underlie the opinion,
attitude, etc., expressed in the first part of the sentence.

Virtually any type of statement structure may occur within an explanatory af clause. The words and
clauses that may precede an explanatory ar clause, however, represent a limited set. This set includes: a few
adjectives (e.g., mabuti ‘good,’ magaling ‘wonderful’); a few unmarked nouns (¢.g., malas ‘bad luck,’ milagro
“miracle,” suwerre ‘good luck’); a few social formulas and interjections (e.g., salamat ‘thanks,’ savang ‘too
S46 CHAPTER 7

bad’); and a set of directional »a- and mag- verbs expressing emotion (e.g., magalak ‘be glad,” sagenalaki ‘be
proud,’ magsisi*be regretful,” magtaka ‘be surprised’, mahiya ‘be embarrassed,’ malungkot ‘be sorry,’
matuwa ‘be happy’), followed by their topics. Some further examples in sentences are:

Magaling at tumulong ang lahat.
‘It’s wonderful (that) everybody helped.”

Milagro at gumaling ang Lolo.
‘It’s a miracle (that) Grandfather recovered.”

Sayang at hindi ka sasama sa kanila.
‘It’s too bad (that) you're not going with them.’

Nagagalak ako at pumasa ako.
‘I'm glad (that) I passed.’

Nagtataka sila at si Juan ang pinili namin.
‘They're surprised (that) Juan was the one we chose.’

Nahihiya ako at wala akong maihahandog na pagkain.
‘I'm embarrassed (that) I have no food to offer.’

Nalulungkot ako at hindi ako makakadalo sa pulong.
‘I’m sorry (that) I won’t be able to attend the meeting.”

§7.21. Topicless phenomenal sentences.
Several types of sentences that lack topic ang phrases are presented in other sections: e.g., sentences

with existential and indefinite may-phrases predicates (§4.23); exclamatory sentences (§4.24); certain
social formulas (§7.22); and interjections (§7.23). The present section is concerned with a set of topicless
sentences expressing atmospheric, temporal, and other phenomena. The English equivalents of these
sentences often begin with the so—called impersonal ‘it’: e.g., ‘It’s raining,’ ‘It’s six o'clock.’ The Tagalog
sentences consist either of a predicate or pseudo—predicate alone, or a predicate or pseudo—predicate plus
one or more adverbials.

The predicates that occur in topicless phenomenal sentences are a small group of adjectivals and
verbals; the pseudo—predicates that occur are certain time adverbs (cf. §6.8). The adjectivals are divisible
into two groups: adjectives expressing atmospheric conditions and abjectives expressing time. The
adjectives in the first group are all 7a- adjectives: e.g., mainit ‘hot,’ maginaw ‘cold,’ malamig ‘cool,’ maulan
‘rainy,’ maulap ‘cloudy.’ These adjectives may constitute sentences by themselves, or may be followed by
one or more enclitic particles or other adverbials, Examples are:

Mainit (na).
‘It’s hot (now).’

Maginaw (pa rin doon).
‘It’s (still) cold (there too).’

Maulan (kung Agosto).
“It’s rainy (in August).’

 
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 547

Adjectives expressing time are maaga ‘early,’ which in ils phenomenal use is frequently followed by
the enclitic particle pa, and gabi ‘late (in the day)’ and tanghali ‘late (in the morning),’ which are normally
followed by the enclitic particle na:

Maaga pa.
‘It’s (still) early.”

Gabi na.
“It’s late (in the day).’

Tanghali na.
‘It’s late (in the moming).’

(The adjectives gabi and tanghali ate homonymous with nouns meaning, respectively, ‘night’ and
‘mid—day.’ The adjectives, unlike the nouns, may be intensified (cf. §4.12); thus, also:

Gabing-gabi na.
“It’s very late (in the day).”

Tanghaling-tanghali na.
‘It’s very late (in the morning).’)

Verbals that occur as predicates of topicless sentences include: a group of -um- verbs expressing
natural phenomena (Awmidiat ‘be lightning,’ Kumulog ‘be thunder,’ gumabi ‘get on towards nighttime,”
humapon ‘get on towards afternoon,” lumindol ‘be an earthquake,’ umaraw ‘be sunny,’ umulan ‘rain’), at
least one mag- verb expressing a natural phenomenon (magbaha ‘be a flood’), a group of mag- verbs
expressing the beginning of a season (magtag-araw/magtag-init/magtaglamig/mag-ulan ‘be the beginning of
the hot (sunny)/hot/cool/rainy season’), a group of mag- verbs expressing time of day (mag-ala-una ‘be one
o'clock,’ mag-hatinggabi ‘be midnight,’ magmadaling-araw ‘be dawn,’ magtanghali ‘be noon,’ mag-umaga ‘be
morning,’ etc.), and at least one »magka-verb (magkagyera ‘be a war’). (The mag- verbs expressing time of
day have no perfective or imperfective forms. The contemplated form occurs only in topicless sentences;
the basic form occurs only after bago — cf. §6.15, subsection (4.a).) Examples in sentences are:

Bumagyo kahapon.
‘There was a storm yesterday.”

Kumikidlat at kumukulog noong gumagabi na.
‘There was lightning and thunder when it was getting on towards nighttime.”

Uulan ba o aaraw bukas?
‘Will it be rainy or sunny tomorrow?”

Lumindol daw at nagbaha sa Mindanaw.
‘They say there was an earthquake and a flood in Mindanao.”

‘There was a war in 1898.’

The time adverbs that occur as pseudo—predicates in topicless sentences are mostly a subclass of nang
point—time adverbs (cf. §6.8, subsections (1.a) and (5); as is noted in subsection (5), the marker nang is
obligatorily deleted before a nang adverb used as a pseudo-—predicate.) One of the enclitic particles na and
pa or a point—time adverb more or less obligatorily accompanies the pseudo—predicate. Some examples

are:
Alas sais
na,
Ika-lima ng Disyembre

six o‘clock
‘It’s (already).’
the fifth of December
Umaga
pa.
Panahon ng ani
morning.’
“It’s still
harvest time.’
Lunes
ngayon.
Araw ng pista
Monday
‘It’s today.”
the day of the feast

A few nouns that do not occur in nang point—time adverbs are also used as pseudo—predicates in
topicless phenomenal sentences: e.g., giyera ‘war(time),’ bakasyon ‘vacation (time),’ as in:

Giyera noon.
‘It was wartime then,’

Yauteur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES sad

Bakasyon pa sa isang buwan.
“It will still be vacation time next month.”

§7.22. Social formulas.

Tagalog social formulas (fixed expressions of greeting, leavetaking, etc.) in some cases conform
structurally to major sentence patterns, basic or derived, in others represent minor sentence patterns. The
most common social formulas are presented below, under the following headings: (1) greetings; (2)
introductions; (3) thanks; (4) apologies and requests for permission; (S) leavetakings; (6) other social
formulas.

(1) Greetings. There is a set of greetings introduced by magandang (maganda ‘beautiful’ plus the
linker na/-ng), which correspond to English greetings introduced by ‘good’:

umaga.
tanghali.

Magandang hapon.
araw.

gabi.

morning.”

morning/afternoon.”
‘Good afternoon.’

day.”

evening.’

(Magandang umaga is used from sunrise to shortly before noon; magandang tanghali is used from shortly
before to shortly after noon; magandang hapon is used from shortly after noon until sunset; magandang
araw may be used at any time during daylight; magandang gabi is used between sunset and sunrise.) These
greetings may be followed by ho or po (the enclitic particles expressing respect — cf. §6.4, subsection (f)),
by the name(s) of the person(s) addressed, by phrases such as sa inyong lahat ‘to you all,’ etc. The response
is a repetition of the greeting, plus, optionally, the enclitic particle din/rin (§6.4, subsection (c)), plus,
obligatorily, the enclitic particle, naman (§6.4, subsection (i)):

umaga
tanghali

Magandang hapon (din/rin) naman.
araw
gabi

The response may also include ho or po (immediately before naman), the name(s) of the person(s)
addressed, etc.
A more informal greeting than the above is:

(Ano,) kumusta?
“(Well,) how are you?’

Kumusta (cf. §7.11), optionally followed by ka or (ho/po) kayo, is also the standard way of inquiring after
someone's health, and may follow some other exchange of greetings. The usual response is:
ikaw
Mabuti (ho/po). (At) naman?
kayo (ho/po)

‘Fine. And you?’
550 CHAPTER 7

to which the reply is:
Mabuti (ho/po) naman.

In addition to the above greetings, which may be used under a wide range of circumstances, there are
many other greetings used only in particular contexts. For special occasions, there are such formulas as:

Maligayang
Pasko.

Magandang
‘Merry Christmas.”

Manigong Bagong Taon.
Masaganang
‘Happy New Year.’

{iene

Maligayang bati.
“Best wishes.’ (Literally: ‘Joyous greetings,’ used on birthdays, anniversaries, etc.)

The conventional response to the Christmas and New Year greetings is:

sa iyo.
Gayon din
(ho/po) sa inyo.

‘The same to you.’

The response to Maligayang bati may be Salamat ‘Thank you’ (cf. subsection (3), below).
Greetings often used on the occasion of a chance encounter on the street are:

Saan ka(yo) pupunta?
(Literally: ‘Where are you going?’)

Saan ang lakad mo/ninyo?
(Literally: ‘Where are you walking?’)

Saan ka(yo) galing?
(Literally: ‘Where are you coming from?’)

The conventional response to all of these is:

Diyan lamang/lang.
(Literally: ‘Just there.”)

A greeting used on the telephone is:

Helo.
‘Hello.’

(This borrowed expression is not used in the other contexts in which English uses it.)
A greeting used by a visitor approaching a house when there is no one in sight is:

Tao po.
(Literally: ‘A person, sir/madam.’)
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 551

To this the conventional response is:

Tuloy po (kayo).
‘Come in.’

A greeting sometimes given to a relative of an older generation is:

Mano po.
(Literally: ‘Hand, sir/madam.’)

The conventional response is:

ka

Pagpalain ng Diyos.
kayo

‘God bless you.”

or

ka

Kaawaan ng Diyos.
kayo,

‘God bless you.’
(Literally: ‘God have mercy on you.’)

(2) Introductions. In formal contexts, a self—introduction consists of one’s name, the enclitic
particle po, and one of the following formulas: ang inyong lingkod ‘your servant,’ pag-utusan ninyo ‘yours
to command.’ The person responding gives his own name, followed by po naman plus one of the same two
formulas. An example of an exchange of self—introductions is:

Pedro Cruz po, ang inyong lingkod.
Juan Reyes po naman, pag-utusan ninyo.

(In informal contexts, one may simply say: Ako si ‘lam “)
Introducing people to one another, one says:

sa iyo
Ipinakikilala ko si .
(ho/po) sa inyo

>

‘V'd like you to meet
(Literally: ‘I am introducing to you )

 

(3) Thanks. ‘Thank you’ is Salamat (ho/po); ‘Thank you very much’ is Maraming salamat or Marami
hong/pong salamat. The conventional response is:

we
anuman.

Wala hong/pong
‘You're welcome.”
(Literally: ‘There isn’t anything.’)
552 CHAPTER 7

Thanks for a favor done may be expressed by:

Salamat (ho/po) sa uulitin.
(Literally: ‘Thank you for the next (favor).’)

Conventional responses to this are:

Sa lahat (ho/po) ng sandali.
“You can count on me any time.’
(Literally: ‘All the time.’)

Nahahanda (ho/po) ako sa lahat ng sandali.
‘I’m ready (to help) any time.’
(Literally: ‘I am ready at all times.’)

(4) Apologies and requests for permission. The usual equivalent of English ‘Excuse me’ is:

Patawad
(ho/po)
Patawarin
{ferme
(Literally: )
‘Forgive.’

Passing between people conversing, one may also say one of the following:

Witesnioes (ho/po). }
Mawalang-galang (na) (ho/po).

“Will ask to pass.’
(Literally: )

‘To be without respect.’

(Mawalang-galang is also uscd in requesting permission under various other circumstances: e.g., permission
to be heard, permission to leave a group, etc.)
The equivalent of ‘I'm sorry’ is:

Ikinalulungkot ko (ho/po).
(Literally: ‘(It) makes me sorry.’)

(5) Leavetakings. The standard formal leavetaking formula is: Paalam na (ho/po); the standard
tesponse to this is Adyos (ho/po). A less formal leavetaking formula is:

ka na.
Diyan
na (ho/po) kayo.

(Literally: ‘You (stay) there now.’)

To this the usual response is: Oo/Oho/Opo (Literally: ‘Yes’ — cf. §7.4). One may also take one’s leave by
saying:

Aalis na (ho/po) ako.
‘I will leave now.”

eur
DERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES 553

or:
Lalakad
na (ho/po) ako.
Tutuloy
‘I will leave now.’

walk
(Literally: ‘I will now.’)
proceed

or, if one is going home:

Uuwi na (ho/po) ako.
‘I will go home now.’

The response to these may be either Adyos (ho/po) or Oo/Oho/Opo.
(6) Other social formulas. Other common social formulas include:

Konggratulesyon(s).
‘Congratulations.’

Mabuhay.

(Literally: ‘Live’ — used as a toast, in which case the response is also Mabuhay, or as the equivalent
of English ‘Hurrah.’)

{ Maligayang \ {erating}

Maluwalhating pagdating.
“Bon voyage.’
‘Happy traveling.’
(Literally: )
‘Splendid arrival.”
Sandali lamang/lang.

‘Just a minute.’
Teka muna.

‘Wait a minute.’ (Jeka is a contraction of (Mag )hintay ka and is used only in addressing people whom
one addresses with the second—person—singular pronoun — cf. §3.3).

Upo
ka(yo).
Maupo.

‘Have a seat.’

§7.23. Interjections.
INTERJECTIONS are words and fixed phrases used to express certain attitudes and emotions. They
do not conform structurally to major sentence patterns. Some of the more common Tagalog interjections

funny!’; Tama! ‘(That’s) right!”; Terible *(That’s) awful!’).
